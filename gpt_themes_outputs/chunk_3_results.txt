Based on the 40 Reddit comments provided, here are five distinct motivations explaining why Singaporeans support the opposition:
•
Enhancing Checks & Balances and Democracy Many voters support the opposition to prevent the ruling party from having excessive power, ensuring greater accountability and transparency in Parliament. They believe a stronger opposition is necessary for Singapore to develop into a more mature parliamentary democracy with robust alternative voices and constructive debate.
◦
"I wish PSP and WP can win 20-30% of seats in parliament. Having opposition literally will mean that the PAP doesnt hv everything going their way. This also ensures fair balance with opposition giving more ideas/debates when necessary."
◦
"An opposition functions as a check and balance on the ruling party. Without elected opposition MPs in Parliament, how exactly do you expect the ruling party to be kept in check?"
◦
"The simple fact that a government with a super majority can never be truly democratic. There must be a way to stop a bill, if you feel it’s wrong, from being passed and currently there isn’t because PAP holds >2/3 of seats."
•
Ethical Concerns and Dislike of PAP Conduct Voters express frustration with the ruling party's ethical standards, perceived arrogance, elitism, lack of transparency, and detachment from the concerns of average citizens. They dislike perceived cronyism, the parachuting of candidates from the civil service or military, and what they see as a lack of accountability for mistakes or misconduct.
◦
"From an ethical/moral standpoint, I can’t bring myself to support the PAP. Lee Kuan Yew had a history of imprisoning his political rivals without a trial... The current generation of PAP leaders have shown that they’re perfectly willing to create laws to do similar things, such as POFMA."
◦
"What’s particularly concerning is that some PAP ministers have made elitist remarks in Parliament... raising questions about whether such attitudes truly represent the values of everyday Singaporeans."
◦
"I hate how the ruling party is so out of touch and arrogant"
•
Addressing Policy Gaps and Citizen Needs Discontent stems from the PAP's perceived failure to adequately address pressing socio-economic issues, including the high cost of living, housing affordability challenges (especially for specific groups like singles), and a perceived lack of focus on ground-level issues and citizen well-being. Voters feel the ruling party is disconnected from their daily struggles and that opposition parties are more attuned to these concerns.
◦
"...there are groups of people in Singapore that are impacted by high cost of living (it is a crisis for them) and housing affordability (it is a crisis for singles)."
◦
"Because it seems the pap forgot that most of us live in hdbs instead of private property.... They're concerned more for the weatlthy than us middle or low income class."
◦
"Opposition - topics and policies more focused on bread and butter, ground issues and around the constituencies."
•
Support for Credible Opposition Many voters support specific opposition parties, particularly the Workers' Party (WP), due to their perceived credibility, competence, professionalism, dedication, and proven track record in areas like town council management and parliamentary participation. They see these opposition figures as genuinely caring, passionate, and capable individuals willing to work hard for residents and challenge the status quo, contrasting them with less impressive or seemingly less motivated ruling party candidates.
◦
"Aljunied voter here and WP has the better candidates."
◦
"The WP is the only opposition party that has successfully run town councils over multiple terms and is the only party that has proved its worth in Parliament. It is Singapore's best chance at allowing a credible alternative to develop."
◦
"Listen to Paul Tambyah or Harpreet Singh talk, these are truly capable people willing to lead a country."
•
Seeking Change and Pluralism Some voters support the opposition simply because they desire change after decades of single-party dominance, believe in the principle of a competitive multi-party democracy, or are generally dissatisfied with the status quo and willing to explore alternatives. This includes frustrations with systemic issues like the Group Representation Constituency (GRC) system, which limits choice.
◦
"It's not about throwing away the 'apple' because it isn't perfect. It's about making sure the apple doesn't rot on the inside without anyone noticing."
◦
"It’s like all your life you have been eating an apple... But you realised the apple is slowly rotting... Someone offers you an orange... Why would you not give the orange a try?"
◦
"The goal isn’t chaos; it’s to encourage a more responsive and resilient political system that works better for everyone..."
