Based on the provided Reddit comments explaining why Singaporeans support the opposition, here are five distinct motivations, grouped as requested:
•
Enhancing Checks & Balances and Democracy Many voters support the opposition to limit the ruling party's dominant power, believing a stronger opposition ensures greater accountability, transparency, and a more balanced political system with diverse voices and competition. They feel that a strong opposition is necessary to keep the ruling party "grounded" or "on their toes" and prevent the unchecked exercise of power that can occur with a supermajority.
◦
"Just to keep PAP grounded."
◦
"Uncomfortable with the super majority status in the parliament."
◦
"Absolute power corrupts absolutely. We cannot give so much power to one party and they can do everything unchecked..."
◦
"pap has been only giving its 89% every other 5 years. i want them to give 200%. in order to do that, they need to feel threatened, awake , kan chiong and feel the pitch."
•
Ethical Concerns and Dislike of PAP Conduct Voters express deep frustration with the ruling party's perceived arrogance, elitism, lack of transparency, and detachment from ordinary citizens' lives. They cite issues like perceived cronyism, abuse of power (such as using laws or election practices), lack of accountability for mistakes, and a decline in the perceived quality, conviction, or honesty of current leaders compared to the past.
◦
"Sick of PAP evading responsibility, talking down, making out of touch statements, fear mongering, gaslighting. Hiding statistics..."
◦
"What’s particularly concerning is that some PAP ministers have made elitist remarks in Parliament... raising questions about whether such attitudes truly represent the values of everyday Singaporeans."
◦
"Absolute power corrupts absolutely... obscene salaries, useless mayors, no accountability, double standards (they can oppo can’t), all the blunders..."
◦
"The previous generation of PAP is long gone... I'm genuinely concerned that the PAP simply does not understand the struggle on the ground, what the average citizen has to deal with."
•
Addressing Policy Gaps and Citizen Needs Significant discontent stems from the PAP's perceived failure to adequately address critical socio-economic issues impacting the average citizen, such as the high cost of living, housing affordability challenges (especially for specific groups like singles or youth), income inequality, job opportunities for locals, and overall quality of life. Voters feel the ruling party is disconnected from their daily struggles, prioritizing elites or foreigners, and that opposition parties are more attuned to these concerns and propose relevant policies.
◦
"Just ask yourself, are u happy with the standard of living of your life thus far? Your job, your house, your NS, your community u live in. IF u want change, u gonna make the change."
◦
"as a young voter, I think I am unfairly pitted against the elite and the rich factions of society. I see an uphill struggle, be it rising to a level of comfortability, or securing proper housing. I don't think the current ruling party is doing much to address this."
◦
"born in 90s graduated with a poly cert, what does the future look for me?, work 25 years to afford a house while seeing your local high paying jobs being outsourced to an expat? what opportunities did the gov really provide? First world country but treated like 2nd class citizen. Serve national Duty 2 years NS,10-15 years reservist in the end just to get treated like this."
•
Support for Credible Opposition Support is given to opposition parties and candidates perceived as credible, competent, dedicated, and caring, contrasting them with perceived shortcomings of ruling party candidates. Voters are drawn to opposition figures they feel have genuine conviction, are "on par" in terms of perceived prestige or capability with ruling party candidates, or belong to parties with historical legitimacy or proven track records in managing constituencies.
◦
"whereas the opposition.. you can feel their convictions."
◦
"PAP introducing new candidates and WP introducing new candidates is basically a new and clean slate for both sides. - both also equally and on par in terms of prestige I guess."
◦
"...workers party founder david marshall was the first elected chief minister when lky was just merely in the opposition... the workers party weren’t nobody."
•
Seeking Systemic Change and Competition Some voters support the opposition because they desire a fundamental shift in the political landscape after decades of single-party dominance or believe that political competition, like market competition, drives improvement. This motivation includes a willingness to try alternatives, sometimes seen as a low-risk way to shake things up and potentially achieve a more responsive and better-functioning system.
◦
"why not give opposition a chance to shake things up? Just ask yourself... IF u want change, u gonna make the change."
◦
"...even if I vote for a 'siaolang' oppo... worst case scenario, I just vote back PAP in the next election. but on the best case, I may attain a favorable outcome..."
◦
"...like how singtel was the only player until starhub and m1 came along... they brought competition and that make everyone better."
