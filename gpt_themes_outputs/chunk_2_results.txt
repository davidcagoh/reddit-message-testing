Based on the provided Reddit comments explaining why Singaporeans support the opposition, here are the distinct motivations grouped into five categories:
•
Enhancing Checks & Balances and Democracy Many voters support the opposition to prevent the ruling party from having excessive power, ensuring greater accountability and transparency in Parliament. They believe a stronger opposition is necessary for Singapore to develop into a more mature parliamentary democracy with robust alternative voices and constructive debate.
◦
"I think denying a supermajority to the PAP is the only way for Singapore to transition into a true parliamentary democracy with a stable constitution."
◦
"An opposition functions as a check and balance on the ruling party. Without elected opposition MPs in Parliament, how exactly do you expect the ruling party to be kept in check?"
◦
"When one party dominates for decades, even with good intentions, blind spots, groupthink, and complacency inevitably creep in. A stronger opposition means more checks and balances, more transparency, and more accountability..."
•
Ethical Concerns and Dislike of PAP Conduct Voters express deep frustration with the ruling party's ethical standards, historical actions, and perceived current behaviour, including concerns about suppression of dissent, cronyism, lack of transparency, arrogance, and elitist attitudes. They dislike what they see as the PAP abusing its power and not listening to the people.
◦
"From an ethical/moral standpoint, I can’t bring myself to support the PAP. Lee Kuan Yew had a history of imprisoning his political rivals without a trial... The current generation of PAP leaders have shown that they’re perfectly willing to create laws to do similar things, such as POFMA."
◦
"For me it's the cronyism... The use of Pofma to not correct but hide the renumeration of the head of the Sovereign Wealth Fund... allow the PAP to get to comfy and all these practices will continue and stay hidden."
◦
"What’s particularly concerning is that some PAP ministers have made elitist remarks in Parliament... raising questions about whether such attitudes truly represent the values of everyday Singaporeans."
•
Addressing Policy Gaps and Citizen Needs Discontent stems from the PAP's perceived failure to adequately address pressing socio-economic issues like the high cost of living, housing affordability for specific groups, and general inequality. Voters feel the ruling party is disconnected from the struggles of average citizens and prioritizes elites, while opposition parties appear more attuned to people's pain points and offer clearer alternative plans.
◦
"...there are groups of people in Singapore that are impacted by high cost of living (it is a crisis for them) and housing affordability (it is a crisis for singles)."
◦
"Because it seems the pap forgot that most of us live in hdbs instead of private property.... They're concerned more for the weatlthy than us middle or low income class."
◦
"on the other hand, the opposition candidates... laid out their plans clearly. their ideas and beliefs resonated with me, and i found myself agreeing with what they proposed... it’s about listening carefully and deciding who actually speaks to my concerns and future."
•
Support for Credible Opposition Voters support specific opposition parties, particularly the Workers' Party (WP), due to their perceived credibility, competence, professionalism, dedication, and proven track record in areas like town council management and parliamentary participation. They see these opposition figures as genuinely caring and capable, contrasting them with less impressive or politically motivated individuals in the ruling party.
◦
"The WP is the only opposition party that has successfully run town councils over multiple terms and is the only party that has proved its worth in Parliament. It is Singapore's best chance at allowing a credible alternative to develop."
◦
"I appreciate the works done in our neighbourhood by the WP team in Sengkang, the team is involved and efficient despite having less resources... The WP team in Sengkang has shown that they are willing to bring up and challenge issues in parliament."
◦
"My take is slightly different. Coming from a conviction/passion POV, what many ppl fail to realise is that the (respectable) oppo are fighting even when they don’t need to... These ppl are doing it because they truly care, not because they got parachuted in or need the salary."
•
Seeking Change and Pluralism Some voters support the opposition simply because they want change, believe in the principle of a multi-party democracy, or are dissatisfied with the status quo and willing to take a risk on an alternative ("try the orange"). This motivation is less about specific grievances and more about the need for competition, choice, and a different political landscape after decades of single-party dominance, and includes frustration with systemic issues like the GRC system.
◦
"It's not about throwing away the 'apple' because it isn't perfect. It's about making sure the apple doesn't rot on the inside without anyone noticing. The goal isn’t chaos; it’s to encourage a more responsive and resilient political system that works better for everyone..."
◦
"It’s like all your life you have been eating an apple... But you realised the apple is slowly rotting... Someone offers you an orange... Why would you not give the orange a try?"
◦
"I'll preface this by saying that I'm more likely to vote opposition because of the GRC system... I don't get to choose my candidate - I have to choose a party instead. That is undemocratic..."
