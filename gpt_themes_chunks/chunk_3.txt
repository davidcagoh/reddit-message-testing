Here are 40 Reddit comments explaining why Singaporeans support the opposition. Group them into 4–6 distinct motivations. For each group, give a short descriptive name, a 1–2 sentence summary, and 2–3 representative quotes (no need to clean grammar). Focus on themes, values, or frustrations expressed.

1. I’m on the fence actually. The current incumbent, Mr Liang Eng Hwa, came over from Holland-Bukit Panjang GRC to run in GE2020 because Dr. Teo retired (Bukit Panjang SMC). He was up against SDP Chairman Dr. Paul Tambyah, who is also contesting in our ward for the first time. So at that time, it is fair game. No one had rapport with any residents. Dr. Paul seemed like the more credible candidate given his resume as a medical professional. To add, Dr. Paul was also involved in COVID-19 related researches (I think?). Dr. Paul eventually lost by 4% (2,509 votes).

Fast forward to today. Under Mr Liang, the town has seen positive developments and some major changes. He has also put in effort to build rapport with the residents through his regular MPS. Even I myself, who once rejected him, is starting to like this man because of the things that has happened and is going to happen in the near future. 

While I really want Dr. Paul to be in the parliament, do I really want risk the town’s development just for a different voice in the parliament?

2. The opp parties in my grc are really cui, cmi... but, i do not want the incumbent to feel too comfortable. I dont recall a moment i have seen my mp ever before over the past 2 elections. And here she is, very likely continuing her role comfortably without much efforts under a heavy weight figure head. I'm very disappointed but I'll still want to do my part!

3. I wish PSP and WP can win 20-30% of seats in parliament. Having opposition literally will mean that the PAP doesnt hv everything going their way. This also ensures fair balance with opposition giving more ideas/debates when necessary. I like the opposition NCMPs that speak up and give their ideas/comments that are usually not aligned to the ideas of PAP. It sparks more debate and more concern towards the life and future of citizens.

4. Even if opposition (WP) gets all the GRCs they contest in, they will not have the majority. Voting them at this point is not going to hand governance over to them. Rather its a symbolic alignment with certain policies/viewpoints they are proposing and putting checks and balances in parliment. If you keep voting for the safe option, they have no incentive to really listen to the public or do any better. Keep in mind they have had major fuckups like trace together where they said one thing, did one thing and nobody ended up being held accountable anyway.

5. "Can a new party do it? Question mark"

The PAP will form the next government, not the WP or any other oppo party. None of the oppos are contesting enough wards to win and form the next government.

At this point in our lives, the oppo exists solely to challenge the policies put forth by the PAP, where relevant, as well as put forth suggestions of their own. The oppo is still quite powerless.

No harm voting an oppo party in if you feel the ones campaigning in your constituency are credible enough. Even if the WP wins 1 or 2 more constituencies, all our ministers will still be PAP members. 

Personally, I hope the oppo parties if elected, voice out more for:
- controlling the sky-rocketing prices of resale HDBs

- changing the BTO scheme to one where you wait for a year or less, rather than booking your flat 5 years in advance cause that's just fucking ridiculous and like it causes some S&D imbalances (I've brought this up to my ex MP Tan Chuan Jin but I found him to be an arrogant chap)

- ensuring a level playing field for fresh graduates in finding jobs here. I used to work at one of the Big 4 auditing firms here. I had a rich Indian national in my team who studied at Boston Uni in the states (nothing great imo, its not harvard or anything lol) who got a job at my firm here, despite having no ties here (no family, never studied here in our unis, nor lived here). It was for an entry level role that some of my well-qualified uni mates applied for and got rejected. Do a proper search on LinkedIn and you'll find many other similar examples.

6. Because the PAP has shown through the years that it is important to them to preserve their power via constitutional changes and amendments. 

In order to ensure that there is never an issue in the future that a corrupt or ineffectual leader is able to use the levers of powers that previous pap leaders have imbued upon the party it is important that a strong opposition not just in civil society but in parliament must exist to highlight when such laws and potential abuses occur.

It is still not enough because no laws have been passed or ministers censured for potential conflicts like in Ridout. While they have cleared themselves, a future leader could very well claim this as precedent for future decisions.

7. From the perspective of a student who didn’t manage to enter a top school, our PAP government emphasises that “every school is a good school.” And I believed in them then, hearing Vivian Balakrishnan commenting “must have been fro. a lousy school” to a politician who came from Raffles Institution made me wonder, if a PAP politician thinks that even a school like RI is a lousy school, what will he think of us Singaporeans who study in neighbourhood schools or any school that is not ACS or NJC? 

It was time for me to wake up and know that the men and women in white are not the angels or saints we think they are, rather they are all residing in high ivory towers while the basic Singaporean has to suffer and survive day by day. Even if they brag about their “humble beginnings”, once they have tasted the flavours of power and influence, they will start becoming out of touch

8. I used to be voting Opposition for opposition sake but nowadays, I'm so tired of hearing the other side blaming and moaning and whining about how bad the PAP is... 

I genuinely want to know how our government (majority or opposition) can help the people. And how we the people can have our voices heard out even more.

9. My friends kept ranting about how stingy the government is, and it’d be better to spend more on yada yada. 

Then I asked them “who’s paying for it? It’s gonna be tax payers, and THAT’S US.” And they fell silent.

Personally, I don’t care who’s in charge as long as I’m content with things. I do see problems with the current system, such as poor cycling infrastructure, oppressing alternate transportations, and banning of vapes, but as a whole, I think things are going well.

But I believe most people vote for opposition to keep the government on their toes. Pretty fair reason I’d say.

10. Aljunied voter here and WP has the better candidates.

11. Because we're tired of being treated like naive wage cucks whose whole existence is to pay for taxes and die 

12. I honestly think Singapore is at our peak and the worst is yet to come. This generation of PAP is sorely incapable of solving issues and does not seem to want to put citizens first. You have it good now, but you shouldn't be so short-sighted. Think about your future. 

Look at the MNCs here. Why do I see so many foreigners in positions like marketing, business development, human resources, recruitment etc which locals can easily fill? This is not going to get any better. 

We need a party that will put Singaporeans first and most opposition parties seem to get that.

13. ‘People actually doing the work’ can you elaborate more on this with an example?

It’s clear you are a PAP supporter. No problems with that. The simple thought process is this, if my Samsung appliance keeps breaking down maybe I will try a Bosch or Midea and see what if it is better. 

If after changing up and Samsung is still better then so be it, I can always go back to Samsung. At least I tried to solve a problem. 

“Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.”

You know why women in abusive marriages never leave? Because they think it is the same in another relationship. It is akin to thinking.. what makes you think can opposition do better? 

Some people are in a bad state so they will vote a dog if a dog could place a deposit. To them anything is better than their current state and they will take that chance. 

In my view, if your life is good and secure. Good salary, 2 cars, private property.. vote what you like.. either is fine. But if you are not working a great job, poor prospects.. cmi standard.. maybe.. maybe a change might be in your best interest.

14. I feel if the elected PAP members have too many duties on hand, why would they pay extra attention to their GRC? 

They try to use anchor ministers to glamour up the town support but that definitely won't translate to extra care for the estate.

15. Different political parties lean differently, as evident from their manifesto, and they resonate with different people. The fact that you label yourself not as a PAP fan means their political leanings do not resonate with you. So vote for whichever party resonate with your political values.

I want to see more opposition in parliament for a more dynamic debate in parliament. I do not believe a larger opposition presence will make a less effective government.

Even if PAP lose a simple majority to an opposition coalition, opposition will just form the government and appoint their own ministers. If PAP first term MPs can be directly appointed as ministers, so can MPs from other parties.

16. I took a quiz https://www.jom.media/cape-ge-quiz/  and apparently PAP is the least similar to my position. It is what it is.

17. Some of them, especially those who have the power, choose to either misuse it or do nothing. It's the condescending remarks, unapologetic attitude and double standards that really makes it infuriating.

18. The simple fact that a government with a super majority can never be truly democratic. There must be a way to stop a bill, if you feel it’s wrong, from being passed and currently there isn’t because PAP holds >2/3 of seats. 
Tbf I’ve been apathetic towards politics in the past, until the reserved presidency issue and I was like 可以这样的meh???

19. An ideal democracy is a government made up with more than 1 party of equal powers. I agree with the Workers Party on denying a super majority. The PAP has its strengths, for sure, but its super majority has shown how it could push unpopular bills through even without needing votes from the opposition. This is unhealthy. 

With that in mind, I am open to voting for the opposition in hope of putting more balance in parliament. However, if there is no credible opposition candidate fielded in my area then I will just go for the least of all evils.

20. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. There needs to be an opposition not for the sake of opposing, but for checks and balances. So if the situation is very imbalanced, then we need to send a message at the polls. Even with lousy opposition in wards that has no hope of winning, it’s still advantageous to the people to make the numbers count against the incumbent. It’s about the numbers and the message. 

A ward that has 35%-45% votes for an opposition party still sends a message that at the end of the day, 40% of the population on average nationwide still does not vote for the incumbent and does not approve. 

21. You’re comparing apples with pears, it’s not a regular job where you get employed based on merit and experience. 

An MP is suppose to be the voice of the people. Also people like Louis Ng (their own people), are swimming in shark infested waters. He got ousted even when he worked hard, it’s not about working hard or not, it’s that as long as you’re not a yes man and cave into their control, submit to the status quo, you’re branded as a troublemaker. 

While useless nepotism hires like Darryl David, who just show face whenever election comes around, ride on the coattails of others, does nothing for 10 years, is still employed. His only work experience is as a one hit wonder TV presenter who reads by script and is incapable of delivering good unique speeches, he’s a pretty vase to bolster the anchor minister's fragile big ego that can't be challenged. He has exhibited NO growth as an MP, for 10 years. 

They WANT to favour the bums who waste the people’s resources and the bums are thick skinned enough to stay on as parasites. How is that fair and why are the hard working people penalised? You must understand that unlike any other job, this job concerns the nation’s future so the duty extends beyond merely silently going about a private life and excelling in any area of expertise. The people are stakeholders so every individual has a say in who gets elected, there’s a national impact. 

Would YOU pay people like Darryl David $13,500 per month? Ask yourself for real, for only having previous experience of a short stint as a D grade public figure with no talent and no impressive resume? Plenty of actors and actresses with talent and build a career beyond one hit wonder, if it‘s fame that PAP wants. This kind of wastage and poor self accountability is what makes me vote opposition so they get the checks and balances like REAL jobs, not cruising along as passengers. They’re entrusted to steer the car and not helplessly watch the car crash into the future and blame the people for not supporting them. 

22. A monopoly never benefit the consumers

23. Miffed about the bto situation. Single, childfree. Restrictions on bto size for singles. Income too high to qualify for a bto. But not high enough to afford a nice resale without paying for it till I die. Elderly parents to look after. Gst, inflation etc hits us too but do not qualify for vouchers. A forgotten group.

24. Cos I just dislike how out of touch and arrogant they are. 

Town hall meetings with a particular ministry has always been a one way transfer of information. I just cannot tahan anymore.

25. I'm not fond of the education system and the arts gov sector in singapore and need new voices. 

For education, instead of chasing trends and wanting perfect score, they should be nurturing interests and talents. 

I say this because I used to teach art. The Direct School Admission policy for P6 kids is ridiculous.

 Firstly parents would have to prep the kids years earlier in art enrichment lessons to have a good portfolio, but that isn't even enough. There are interviews, exams, and passing that, your PSLE score will have to hit the school usual admissions scores before you can get in. Then what is the frigging point??? 

Why must they be a great orator/leader/have anazing grades/ showcase their unique personalities at 12 years old so they can do art???

Then our NAC. Why must so many projects be about drawing singapore history or singapore culture? The artist that is drawing is singaporean. Nurture them instead of forcing them to make "singaporean art". Then they will be part of singapore's history and culture.

26. Truthfully, most just have an axe to grind against the PAP - real or imagined. I guess life has been cruel to some, but most of what these people go through are of their own doing. It's easier to blame someone else for your problems than to take ownership of it.

27. I’m open minded but I don’t need Singapore to change. I’m happy with what it’s going on, how the country is being governed, and happy with my life and the security we have here.

28. my 2 cents take on the matter:

Im on the fence with both. PAP is good but can be better. Opposition meanwhile, (ok for simplicity's sake, lets mainly consider SDP PSP and WP), is also good, however so far as far as i can see doesn't have many super convincing individuals that will instantly make me "ok let's vote for oppo in". A few reasons regarding this stance:

* Many people, including opposition parties, have been harping on the 2% gst increase. Rough calculations based off the budget 2025 at least, suggests that the 2% gst is indeed actually effectively offset using the vouchers. In fact, more than that is actually covered, depending on your spending power (the lower, the higher the subsidy/ set off) etc. Ok hear me out ah, based off google summary at least: In 2023, the average Singaporean household spent $5,931 monthly. This translates to 71,172 annual, and a 2% increase roughly translates out to 1423 per yr ish. However, lets check the budget 2025.  
   1. Sg60 vouchers 600
   2. Assurance package 100-600
   3. GST voucher scheme 450 - 850
   4. Culture pass 100
   5. Activesg 100
   6. Personal income tax rebate 0-200
   7. CDC vouchers 800
   8. U-save 440 - 760
   9. s&cc rebate 1.5-3.5 months offset
   10. climate vouchers 400
* So, u are getting anywhere from 2990 minimum up to 4k+, and this covers way more than the median household increment they would face from 2% GST. If we only look at pure cash they give straight up (so exclude rebate, climate vouchers etc), 800 + 600 + 100 (CDC voucher + sg60 voucher + minimum from AP), and its alr more than 1400. Shit on PAP all you want, but lets give credit where its due: They really did offset the 2% increase for at least 50% of the populace, and for the rest, come on la, you are already earning more than the rest, and you spend way more on non-necessities, not really PAP's fault liao right? PAP did highlight this increase has been delayed for quite some time (Even back in 2012, there was talks of increasing GST to 10%, although this was met with immense backlash), and now they cannot put it off any longer in view of an ageing population and needing more funds to tackle this. Unpopular opinion, but i cannot find fault with this logic at all. 

* What i can however find fault with, is the fact that inflation is rather high. The number in % doesn't seem a lot, but the trickle-down effects is very much present in our everyday expenses. Pre COVID i rmb my avg cai fan being like 4-4.50 max, now its like 5-5.50 (wtf?) in my area. Yeah, its not that i dont understand its due to factors p much outside PAP's control, however, they can definitely do better in this regard, in mitigating the effects at least.

29. Thanks for the very mature attempt to understand other people's perspective without mudslinging etc. This is what our country needs to mature politically.

For me, I vote mainly on character, for better or for worse. I am not so noble as to vote based on what is best for my neighbourhood or for the country. I am just a normal self-interested average Jane asking just one question: which group of people would I rather talk to at the MPS when s*** happens in my life (never say never, and it has happened to me before twice) and I desperately need help? 

To put it in the most polite way possible, I evaluate based on three criteria:
1) is the team approachable, not just logistically (orderly queues and system) but emotionally? I.e. will I feel like I have to say grandmother's story just to get the other side to understand 10% of my issues? Or it's more rapport and 心有灵犀一点通 (I think what youngsters call "vibing")
2) throughout the whole process do I get the "we are honoured to serve you" vibe or do I get the "you are a charity case/your issue is hardly an issue in our perspective and you should be appreciative that you are even allowed to join the queue" vibe
3) do I genuinely believe that they will actually tackle my concerns, not just by writing the requested letters, but by raising the issues in Parliament so the root cause of my problem is resolved?

Let's just say that 1) I do not live in Hougang. 2) I am a very unhappy customer. 3) to answer the "what does the opposition offer" part of your question, for the opposition that is contesting in my area, I see a great deal of potential of them meeting my three criteria listed above. Of course there is no "try before you buy", but that's life.

Sorry for the vagueness, I cannot provide further details, because my job actually has a social media policy that restricts what I can or cannot say online, and that policy is very vague. I might not even be able to reply to any replies. Even me posting with an anonymous Reddit account is me taking a risk employment wise. But your question is worth me taking the risk.

30. Why I am voting opposition

1. over crowding on public transports. Feel like I am forever squeezing or being pushed and it is pretty infuriating
2. I don't see myself as a single being able to own a house in my lifetime
3. I feel like my education did not lead me anywhere
4. fuck NS not because I hated serving but because I was not compensated for my time and while I was serving my foreign peers are in school, working and finding girlfriends
5. I hate being promised things that never arrive
6. No effective action against smokers in HDB though it was tested in the past.
7. No effective action against loud cars/motorcycles that come to my HDB carpark at 11pm to 3am to rev.

Things I am thankful right now

1. No capital gains tax and can invest in equities without fear of having to figure out taxes BUT this leads to foreigners being able to invest and flip houses increasing the price of not only condos but HDB as well.
2. Relatively safe but I have to ask if we keep importing foreigners from everywhere will it stay safe?
3. I am still able to find jobs even as I am a failure though the jobs I get are extremely bad or back breaking and I have had to leave 4 jobs in the last year and as I get older I don't think I will be able to get a job for long
4. My town council is actually pretty good but the guy left lol
5. that I can and will vote opposition

31. I will support opposition because I wanna pay 37% income taxes to fund free healthcare. I want to reduce GST. I want my HDB value to stagnate. I want to reduce FDI. I wanna become an isolationist city state, where the government is for the people and we only employ our own 😎. I also want to take global issues and put them in my manifesto while surreptitiously meeting religious leaders and disavowing them once I’m called out. I also want to try to combine that religious fundamentalism with gender pronouns and gender affirming surgery so that I can win both the fundamentalist vote and the progressive votes.

32. Do you see most ruling party MPs debate during Parliament sitting? Or rather sitting there listening, playing phones or even dozing off?

If the above ever happen? What do u think causes such behaviour? Do u think they will do the same if everybody inside the Parliament comes from different parties & participating heavily and seriously in the discussion? So that they will start to wake up & open their mouths?

33. PAP - Bigger picture, pushing the country towards prosperity. People that get left behind in the process have to catch up themselves. 

Opposition - topics and policies more focused on bread and butter, ground issues and around the constituencies.

I like my ministers to be PAP and my MPs to be opposition =)

34. 2 big issues:  
1) Checks and balances -> Remember the last time PAP's vote share increased & they had a thumping majority in 2015, what happened after that? Anyone remember the 2017 Presidential "Election"? What about GST hikes? What about POFMA? I don't think that giving them unchecked power is good for Singapore, in any way shape or form. And when more opposition MPs are fielded into Parliament, like in GE2020, they start to work even harder.  
2) Immigration -> I seriously feel like a foreigner in my own country. I look left look right, there are so many foreigners. Currently in my university, everywhere I go on campus, there is at least a foreign student in my line of sight. It's too many foreigners. And no, I am not studying in an international school, it's a local uni. And these are the people that will compete with me for jobs when I graduate.

35. Why I would vote opposition this GE.

1) To prevent PAP from becoming an echo chamber and promote diversity of opinion. Specifically, I am uncomfortable with so many civil servants being parachuted into various high level roles without (in my opinion) relevant credentials and experience. 

Case in point, NTUC income saga - this was such a typical M&A / PE strategy, that anybody who had some experience in investment banking could smell this miles away. It really makes me question the leaders competence since they said it was in "good faith" as well as whether the overall plan of air-dropping ex-generals into various high ranking places makes sense. 

2) I personally feel that some PAP candidates are less hungry to improve the system, instead are just satisfied with maintaining the status quo. This in the long-run will result in organizational inefficiency and stagnation, which I actually do see within certain civil service branches. Any system that does not evolve will be left behind, as we have seen with many of the old-gen "famous" local companies (e.g. Hin Leong's lack of proper risk management)

On the other hand, WP candidates overall seem competent and eager to prove their worth and willing to question existing status quo for improvement. I believe that this is good for any well functioning organization. Sadly, I find it hard to say the same for most other opposition parties. 

On specifically housing affordability, 

WP's manifesto kind of addresses it in a mild-way with the overarching message that houses are meant for Singaporeans to stay in, instead of being seen as a safe haven investment. I agree with the message but not the implementation steps, which I feel could be more forceful (probably to err on side of caution with voters). 

Tried and tested ways of making investment properties less attractive could include taxing rental income / capital gains on non-owner occupied properties, increasing property tax for non-owner occupied properties significantly or even like a hefty estate tax on non-owner occupied properties.

36. PAP isn’t what it used to be. I don’t trust elitist out of touch politicians like Vivian and Jo. 

Can you imagine anyone from WP be caught on air saying “ He’s illiterate”, how did he get into RI?” and “Must be a lousy school”. Or messing up with the ACRA nric policy?

Listen to Paul Tambyah or Harpreet Singh talk, these are truly capable people willing to lead a country. The only person comparable would have been Tharman. But too bad Singapore “isn’t ready for an Indian Pm”.

37. Take a look at the WP team in Aljunied and Sengkang. Look at how theyve grown, and you can see real true passion and genuineness from them in wanting to better the political scene and help their residents. Its bloody tough being the opposition, and the PAP purposely makes it ridiculously tough, yet they still chose to be opposition and work extra hard for their passions.

on the other hand, look at some of these people living in their civil service bubble, being parachuted in from god knows where. The system makes it super easy for them to get in (just get into a GRC with SMLee or LW or shan) and they can literally cruise their way into parliament without any accountability. Just do what the party wants you to do, collect a nice pay, dont rock the boat, and even working hard for the residents is optional. These people will barely work for you and couldnt give two shits about your wellbeing, for them its all about prestige and money rather than pure passion.

I like WP because I have a neat ability to see right through peoples intentions and I can sniff a snake from miles away. WP people have always been genuine and have walked the talk. And thats why I like them more because theyre much more relatable than the rigid robots in white.

38. I think I don’t like the fact that a lot of the pap candidates are like from organisation like the army and parachute to their high positions. I suspect most of them don’t even want the post, and so they might not have the willing heart to serve the best to the people.

39. I hate how the ruling party is so out of touch and arrogant

40. We need more alternative voices in parliament to question policies from the incumbent. Last time PAP got a strong mandate and lol look at the reserved presidency and other nonsense we got. 

Plus if there is one PAP candidate in a GRC that I don’t like all the more I’m not going to vote for PAP in that GRC even if there are other deserving candidates on that slate 

It’s ok, we know there are people (like you) that vote PAP so it’s up to us to put opposition MPs in parliament
