Here are 40 Reddit comments explaining why Singaporeans support the opposition. Group them into 4–6 distinct motivations. For each group, give a short descriptive name, a 1–2 sentence summary, and 2–3 representative quotes (no need to clean grammar). Focus on themes, values, or frustrations expressed.

1. I think denying a supermajority to the PAP is the only way for Singapore to transition into a true parliamentary democracy with a stable constitution. I'll vote for any non-clown opposition (ie. not anti-vax, not too Trumpy, etc.)

2. Here's my attempt to answer your questions, even though these points have already been brought up time and time again by the WP and other opposition parties. I apologise for the long post. 

1. An opposition functions as a check and balance on the ruling party. Without elected opposition MPs in Parliament, how exactly do you expect the ruling party to be kept in check? Does the PAP need 97/97 seats to function? No. But having a sizeable opposition presence allows for constructive debates in Parliament on alternative policy ideas as well as the drawbacks and tradeoffs of policies that PAP seeks to implement, so that the public is kept informed. And the WP has been functioning as that check and balance for years now and 4 out of the top 5 MPs that filed the most PQs and participated the most in Parliamentary debates were from the WP. 

2. Constitutional amendments can only be passed with a 2/3 majority in Parliament. All other decisions can be passed with a simple majority. Why? Because the constitution is the highest law of the land. The fact that the PAP can, and has, amended the Constitution so many times despite public disapproval should be a cause of concern. The most controversial amendment passed in recent memory is the amendment of the Constitution to reserve the Presidency for a minority candidate. Even minorities were opposed to this, as it reeks of tokenism. Minorities want to be elected on merits too. And the amendments only effectively prevented the then very popular TCB from contesting the elections. Another controversial amendment is the introduction of the NCMP scheme, where non-elected losing candidates have rights to vote on important legislation. How is this democratic? Which is why, for years, opposition parties have been asking for Singaporeans to deny the PAP a 2/3 majority. In every other democratic society, having more than 60 out of 97 seats in Parliament would be considered a great victory. 

3. A large opposition party with resources and members that has the ability to form a shadow Cabinet cannot form out of thin air. It has to develop over time. And the closest we have to a credible, alternative party other than the PAP is the WP because it has won the most seats of any opposition party. The WP is volunteer driven at its core. It does not have a large policy team. And yet, time and time again, they have come up with alternative policy ideas and pathways to implementation. They are not throwing shit at the PAP or at our civil service and criticising for the sake of criticising. They know Singaporeans expect practical, feasible policies and that is exactly what they have been trying to come up with. Some may be good, some may be bad but in a democracy, you debate and you compromise and eventually, you reach a landing that works for all stakeholders. Not have one party dominate all discussions.

4. The ones doing the actual work is not the PAP. It is our civil service, which is supposed to be apolitical. But because they work for the Government of the day and the PAP has been the Government all these years, the civil service is often seen as intertwined with the PAP. But the civil service is made up of exemplary, hardworking individuals and is the biggest resource at the disposal of the PAP. They are the ones coming up with policy ideas and they are the ones working behind the scenes and consulting stakeholders to find out what works, what are the trade-offs etc. These are the people who deserve the credit, not the PAP. But that doesn't mean the civil service doesn't have blind spots because they are simply following their boss's instructions. They work on a particular ideology. The role of an opposition is to help identify these blindspots that may be missed because of group think. 

5. Ironically, the party that continually harps on us being in a crisis is the PAP. They tell us Singapore is entering turbulent waters and they need a strong mandate to govern. The opposition tells you that Singapore will be better off with them checking on the PAP even as we enter these turbulent waters. It is up to you to decide which you agree with. And while you may be privileged enough to not feel it, there are groups of people in Singapore that are impacted by high cost of living (it is a crisis for them) and housing affordability (it is a crisis for singles). 

In short, the answer to your question is, if you don't try, you will never know. The WP is the only opposition party that has successfully run town councils over multiple terms and is the only party that has proved its worth in Parliament. It is Singapore's best chance at allowing a credible alternative to develop. Them losing seats will be a setback for democracy in Singapore, in my opinion. But I do respect the alternative view which is that PAP has a good system of internal checks and balance, has offered Singaporeans stability for years and may operate best when it has an extremely strong mandate.

3. From an ethical/moral standpoint, I can’t bring myself to support the PAP. Lee Kuan Yew had a history of imprisoning his political rivals without a trial, where they were treated extremely inhumanly, and later on, when that wasn’t as easy anymore, dragging them into the court to bankrupt them. He went on to remove the Law Society’s ability to stop the courts from being abused, etc. The current generation of PAP leaders have shown that they’re perfectly willing to create laws to do similar things, such as POFMA. There may be no equivalent to ISD today, but there doesn’t need to be. Just make a law, and then fuck people over with it if they dare dissent. 

All the checks and balances that existed in the past to prevent the PAP from abusing their power have been removed. The *only* thing left is voting, and they gerrymander the shit out of it every god damn election. The media is controlled by the state. The PAP withheld quality of life upgrades that should have been given out to every citizen, which is basically blackmail. They may not be doing it now, but there hasn’t been much effort to dispel that notion. The pervasive belief that your job in the civil service is dependent on you voting the PAP continues to live on. I wish they would just come out and say it explicitly, that your civil service job would not be affected at all by voting opposition, but I suppose it benefits the incumbent to let that belief stay.

The fact that they’ve built this cult of personality around LKY is just the shitty icing on the cake really. The whole narrative around the sleepy fishing village, third world to first blah blah blah, all so that they can whore out his memory to get people to vote for them… it’s pathetic. And kinda disgusting. It benefits them to gloss over all his wrongs because he’s basically worshipped; for all the emphasis on how LKY didn’t want his house to become a shrine, it’s funny that the people who keep parroting that are the ones who very much revere him and treat his word as law. So much for not wanting to be deified.

And so they continue hoarding power, paying themselves exorbitant salaries, implying that it’ll somehow prevent corruption, all while refusing to define a poverty line and implement minimum wages. Didn’t work for Iswaran, did it? So should we pay them even more then?

In the words of Sylvia Lim, they’re little more than “mercenaries at the helm”, wielding their absolute power to maintain their chokehold on us.

4. Simply because I'm not a big fan of enabling bullies

5. Regardless, the PAP will remain the government in power. Even with new faces, the same senior leaders continue to hold control, and these newcomers often appear to be groomed to follow directives without substantial influence.

What’s particularly concerning is that some PAP ministers have made elitist remarks in Parliament and still continue to represent us Singaporeans. For instance, in September 2021, during a parliamentary debate on jobs and foreign worker policies, Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan was caught on a hot mic referring to Progress Singapore Party NCMP Leong Mun Wai as “illiterate” and questioning how he got into Raffles Institution, adding, “Must have been a lousy school.”  Despite public backlash and calls for accountability, Dr. Balakrishnan remained in his position, raising questions about whether such attitudes truly represent the values of everyday Singaporeans.

Supporting the opposition is crucial because it helps keep the PAP in check. Opposition parties are often more driven to enact real change and are more attuned to the needs and concerns of the people.

6. i’m currently still on the fence, but leaning towards voting opposition. i took the time to listen to both pap’s and the opposition’s speeches during the political broadcast.

- pap’s speech emphasised that they’ve been with singapore every step of the way. i understand that’s really meaningful for the merdeka and pioneer generations, but as a gen z, that message didn’t really connect with me.
- they also talked about things like affordability, but didn’t actually lay out specific plans or measures. it felt a bit vague.
- on the other hand, the opposition candidates didn’t resort to personal attacks against pap, which is important to me because it shows a level of maturity and respect that’s much needed.
- more importantly, they laid out their plans clearly. their ideas and beliefs resonated with me, and i found myself agreeing with what they proposed.

initially, based on first impressions, how they presented themselves, and finding out a little bit about each candidate, i felt like i trusted the pap candidates more than the opposition. but i think this changed it for me. it’s not about blindly hating the pap or even blindly supporting the opposition. it’s about listening carefully and deciding who actually speaks to my concerns and future. 

but anyway, i also haven’t had any further engagement with either side yet, so we’ll see how things go in the next week before election day hehe

7. For me it's the cronyism. Anyone remember the $5 IT company owned by a PAP member whose only contract was the Town council management software. It was only 12 years ago. It would have remained hidden if WP didn't win the GRC. 
The use of Pofma to not correct but hide the renumeration of the head of the Sovereign Wealth Fund, who is not a civil servant, not elected nor officially part of the government in any capacity.

The blatant misbehaviour of the Parliamentary committee that was investigating the WP for the Raeesah Khans lie case, where witnesses were allowed to delete evidence already submitted. 
I'm not against every policy of the PAP and there are some opposition figures who are so nuts I would never vote for them, but allow the PAP to get to comfy and all these practices will continue and stay hidden. Only when opposition has enough power can we get transparency.
In my opinion PAP abuses it's position as the government and I don't like bullies.

8. Reactive, not proactive.

I've always been a supporter of PAP but recent incidents over the past few years have shown that they need to be put in check. 

A situation happens — they would try to do damage control or find some suitable reasonings for their decisions, and then leave it as it is or pretend it doesnt happen at all. With a sensible number of oppositions, they will have to remain competitive and be liable for their decisions.

Also, I listen to their parliament meetings, and I'm bewildered at how empty it is. The people have chosen you, only for you to not be at your seat??

9. I support the opposition not because I think they are flawless or guaranteed to be better, but because competition keeps any system healthy.

When one party dominates for decades, even with good intentions, blind spots, groupthink, and complacency inevitably creep in. A stronger opposition means more checks and balances, more transparency, and more accountability, even if they don't form the government immediately.

It's not about throwing away the "apple" because it isn't perfect. It's about making sure the apple doesn't rot on the inside without anyone noticing.

The goal isn’t chaos; it’s to encourage a more responsive and resilient political system that works better for everyone, including PAP supporters.

That's why I vote for the opposition: not to destroy, but to improve.

10. Jail from home due mishandled resources and trust.
Fking populist from a 'fair & just' speaker

Do you feel safe? 

Also, have you see LW respond to GST recently?

11. I'm from Sengkang, this will be my first time voting in GE (turned 21, not because I'm a new citizen) and I will be supporting the opposition in this election. 

I appreciate the works done in our neighbourhood by the WP team in Sengkang, the team is involved and efficient despite having less resources (i.e. proper venue for MPS, manpower, etc.) than the PAP.

The WP team in Sengkang has shown that they are willing to bring up and challenge issues in parliament. They also seem to be more down to earth and aware of the issues of the average Singaporean.

I have met the Sengkang PAP team at events and walkabouts, and I don't have completely negative feelings towards them. I like Dr Elmie, he seems to be the most down to earth and friendliest of the bunch, but I'm not particularly fond of the rest of the team. Bernadette being born and raised wealthy and privileged seems to be out of touch with the reality of an average low-middle income Singaporean. There's a Business Times article where she mentioned that one of the biggest challenges in the F&B industry is well-travelled Singaporeans being aware of dining trends and not wanting to spend in Singapore because they are saving up for their next trip...??? There are hawkers worrying about rental prices, consumers worrying about rising costs but this is what she brings up...

I don't think I want to see more pawns in the parliament who do not truly care to know and understand the more pressing issues we are facing.

12. Truth be told a lot of Redditors hate for the sake of hating. As an oppo supporter there is not a shadow of doubt in my mind that PAP is the best Government there is for Singapore — you need only look out your window and around you for the evidence.

A family friend (hardcore PAP supporter since the 70s/80s) told me recently: Don’t listen to the oppo; the PAP are the ones who built Singapore. You know what? I agree entirely with him — and that’s why I vote oppo. Because LKY, the man who built Singapore, was alive today, he would not have allowed for the 4G batch to be in the state that they are now.

Where LKY was decisive and bold, the 4G is secretive and suspicious. Where LKY decried those who treat politics as a “game of cards”, the 4G has shuffled anchor Ministers around like poker chips in the eleventh hour before nomination. And where LKY was loyal to Singaporeans, creating and guarding our financial interests, the 3G/4G seems to be loyal to KPI, GDP and _Allianz_, of all things. 

That is my honest reason for voting opposition. The PAP I believe is a rare example of a Government which is truly free of corruption and capable of leading Singapore for many decades to come. But in order to prevent them from becoming blind, arrogant, and out of touch, they must continue to feel the pinch during elections — for, more than anything else, this batch of 4G Ministers needs to be reminded that they are not above reproach, or politically immortal.

13. You need to know that reddit is a bubble. Do your own homework then vote accordingly. It was like this the last GE too. Then after GE when PAP won, redditors started mocking those who voted PAP. Same thing for US elections. Redditors seemed cock sure Kamala will win.  For me if oppo is good then I’ll vote oppo. PAP or oppo doesn’t matter.

14. Because I believe in checks and balances.

15. The calibre of candidates after 2000 has been declining, including the policies they come up with compared to the first generation leaders. They always compare us to other countries instead of themselves in the past and says that the country is improving. We need to ask ourselves, are we better than yesterday or are we better than xxx country.

16. The PAP does a good job economically and operationally. They aren't so great with social issues or citizens' rights. Ramming through warrantless searches, putting the definition of marriage into the constitution, severely disadvantaging LGBTQ people and singles in an increasingly expensive housing market, POFMA being used against their critics or any whiff of criticism etc.

Our system is very dependent on having a good leader at all times. Currently, if a Trump-like figure rises in the PAP, he or she can easily take over and we are cooked. The PAP has recruited people like Ivan Lim who looks good on paper and can manage up, but do not have the best interests of those under him at heart.

I do think it is in our best interest in the long term to have more opposition checking the govt and eventually forming a shadow cabinet. No party or organization is immune from making mistakes or trusting the wrong people to lead. That way they can be made accountable for bad decisions, and they start taking into account more than just the voices of people like them when formulating policies.

17. Because it seems the pap forgot that most of us live in hdbs instead of private property.... They're concerned more for the weatlthy than us middle or low income class. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/s/6tqnW3HxpN

18. your premise is opposition is going to be worse than pap...which is fear mongering.

wp was the government of the day before pap became one,if your logic worked then today's singapore will be a very different one.

there isn't balance in parliament nor representation,policies are not debate nor discussed for the well being and interests of the people,just pap and their cronies.

until there is balance in parliament,until there is consultation with the people, there will never be any reason to vote pap.

fuck pap.

19. It’s like all your life you have been eating an apple. But you realised the apple is slowly rotting and you don’t want it to eat it anymore. Someone offers you an orange - you don’t have to commit to the orange yet, but you can have a lick to see if you like it or not.

Why would you not give the orange a try? Surely it’s better than eating a rotten apple ? At the very least, now you have two different fruits to try.

20. Because a pap Minister once said we need to FIX THE OPPOSITION, that itself is very clear the whole parliament is an echo chamber

21. Beyond the common themes of ntuc, double standards etc..

Why do we need to pay the government of the day so much to make a decision based on the work that is done by your family and friends in the public and civil service? Based on this, the fear mongering is unnecessary and putting themselves on a pedestal is just...

The people working in the public and civil service are made to be disconnected with the common people because they have to please the elites with quick wins and what they want even when it is not what the people need.

Also let's not forget the elitism where scholars have a whole new level of trajectory to draw amazing salary and get great exposure while as long as you are not one of them, you will continue to get by averagely unless you meet a rare one.

Singapore needs a thorough leadership shake up if Singapore truly wants to be a thriving country for it's native people.

22. When I see HHH contesting, does it still make sense to vote for opposition for the sake of it? My answer is a big fat NO!

23. I agree, I’m not the biggest fan either but it is always easier to fault the incumbent with hindsight. Anyone can point out current issues that we have, but not everyone can solve it.

24. If you work in a company, which has various teams:  
The internet(MRT) keeps going down, and the IT team tell you that just how machines are, there is no point doing over maintenance, without getting to the root of the problem, will you accept it?

If the HR team tells you need to carry 3 chunky employee access cards(OBU & ERP2.0) for them to track your location/attendance, when many other companies' employees are just using a small compact one, is that ok with you?

If your project team has these individuals who never turn up for meetings, or sleep during the meetings, will you want them to continue?

The above are just trivial examples. Go listen to the WP rallies, you don't have to sit through the entire rally, but you will definitely hear serious issues, especially those made by the senior politicians. Look at their manifestoes. They have proposed solutions.  Have a think about it.

25. I usually support whoever is good and credible, but I also agree that PAP shouldn't have a super majority. The thing about the opposition is that most of them are super cui, other than WP. And I'm worried that we end up having a freak election like the U.S. or Brexit if everyone vote for the oppos blindly (I know that this is super unlikely).

I want a good and credible opposition to vote on but I don't have that in my area sadly.

Just look at parties like PPP and RP. I can't imagine them going into parliament and representing Singapore on the international stage. It's like allowing a newbie driver to pass his license even though you know he cmi, and he ends up killing himself and others. Most of them just keep bitching anyway and doesn't have any concrete ideas.

Another thing which I think the opposition parties lack severely are succession planning. Other than WP, the rest are mostly a 1-2 men show with no clear and good candidate to take over in future. PSP is probably going to be gone in a few years after TCB pass on.

26. 
⸻

I’ve been watching introduction videos of opposition party candidates (WP and PSP), and all of them clearly articulated what motivated them to run for election.

That got me curious about the new MP from the incumbent party who’s seeking re-election—but I struggled to get a clear sense of who she is, what she stands for, or what drives her.

The outgoing MP encouraged residents to support her, highlighting her kindness and compassion. But really, aren’t those just basic expectations? Surely, no one campaigning for public office would admit to being mean-spirited.

The new candidate spoke about the doubts she and her family had about stepping forward, and vaguely expressed a desire to “have a bigger impact, to make a bigger difference.” Yet, it was difficult to pin down what kind of change she hopes to bring, or what truly compels her to serve.

I did come across a video of her speaking at the party’s annual gathering, where she explained that she became a branch activist because she wanted to protect Singapore from what she described as populist policies proposed by opposition parties to win votes. That finally offered a glimpse into her perspective—but it also worries me, because the PAP often tends to label any alternative ideas from the opposition as “populist,” dismissing them without genuine engagement.

Now more than ever, we need different views and fresh solutions. If someone’s main motivation is simply to defend the status quo, I find it hard to see that as a calling worth rallying behind.

27. too many incumbents keep thinking that their personalities are bigger than the problems in the modern world even after being showed up again and again.

the maga like personality cults they keep trying to entertain whilst two facing it complaining about online and religious extremism, everythings upside down. ah and all the usual failure to keep up infrastructure, dog whistling racism and xenophobia.

and just for the ones who dig into account histories, im super pro immigration and actual true cosmopolitan diversity rather than whatever this thin facade called cimo is. also a big fan of foreign property and dual citizens kek

28. Its good you brought it up, because theres some form of hypocrisy (not ALL, but some) for pro-oppo individuals. For them, they are a beneficiary of a right-leaning pro business system in which the incumbent built from ground up but now want to bite the hand that fed them - it really doesn't make much sense.

You can refer to the singapore thread:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/s/NFERc9iMky](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/s/NFERc9iMky)

Look at the comments on like - 

1. only tax landed property, but not 1M HDB flats (then now why are you reducing the avenue of taxation then?)

2. as long as I'm not the tax bracket that is affected, its fine with me. (so now what happens if it affects you. are you going to swing to the incumbent? I'm going to expect ALOT of elephants in the room already once WP's policies do not benefit you)

This is irony at its finest and the same feminism crap debate THAT is still going on - people only want to cherry pick their wins and refuse to accept any drawbacks. And this is the true elephant in the room, in which people refuse to admit they only want policies for their selfish gain and will gladly swing themselves to other side once they aren't a beneficiary of a system.

  
So what you are missing here is because the surface level arguments are too muddied and circular in nature - dig past the surface and you will see only self-interest wrapped in abstract justifications.

However, I'd like to highlight that this is not representative of the other branch of folks that need to lean left (for political, economic, social, cultural, reasons) - there is a deeply rooted justification and I'm all for it.

  
So with that out of the way, lets get back to the question on "what exactly are you voting opposition for?"

In a system that benefits a class of individuals and that one is not a true beneficiary of - obviously one would like to push for left wing ideologies in a deeply rooted right leaning dominant system - think of the slightly less skilled folks who are 1 layoff away from financial trouble or because the floodgates were open for external employment in which wages are depressed. Or perhaps those individuals that want a more open left ideology related to gender fluidity, acceptng other woke cultural norms, etc. Or even specific sagas that left bright folks thrown under the bus (the bio sector push in the early 2010s, but the govt bailed out eventually - so think of the straight A student entering uni with a bioengg degree under the govt's empty promises and essentially received early carerr suicide. we can go on here but you get the gist.

so its my opinion here - but we should all look into the ideologies behind a polititcal system (left vs right) and then stand by it in a principled way. Its really not so much on the circular reasoning, the checks and balances or deny the super majority, or the selfish mindset of "whats in it for me". 

(altho i do know that this wont happen. thats why we always call society a sinkie pwn sinkie mentality.)

29. You said PaP can do better. If we don't vote any opposition in. Who is to tell PAP that they can be better? Who to tell them where they can improve?

I know PAP is not going to change anything for us especially if they continue to have more than 2/3 of the seats.

Also if apple is rotten, I have no choice but switch to orange. Yes if the next batch of apples prove to be fresh then I might switch back to them. But i am not eating the rotten apple.

30. Its always multi-party democracy for me. Get there, and then we can discuss fairly and constructively policies that benefit Singapore. PAP used to have all of their shit together, now they increasingly don't, and they fix opposition and gaslight Singaporeans to remain on top.

If they truly think they are the best for Singapore, remove all of the partisan handicaps (EBRC gerrymandering, non-elected losers cosplaying as GRAs, partisan mainstream media, POFMA for opinions they dislike etc) and fight a fair election. They played dirty and they won 61% in 2020; what would their actual vote share be like if they played fairly?

31. I do agree that the amount of blind hate on PAP is a bit much on here. It's very reactionary

not all opposition parties are the same, for example the PSP is literally founded by an ex-PAP executive committee member. but they have different policy ideas which I support, and I find myself drawn to their proposals. 

wouldn't say i'm a opposition supporter, I would say i'm a policy-focused voter ;)

32. WP imo is the only credible one that must have more seats in parliament. Just look at the background of their candidates. Those guys are top professionals that don’t have to come into politics. They are the one that are in touch with the locals and will stand up for Singaporeans.

33. I'm not big on politics and hardly follow any news of politicians,  but I'm voting opposition for a simple reason: from my day-to-day, I feel the current ruling party doesnt care about the people.

I'm in EC GRC and the most I've seen just the last 4-5 years have been repainting of HDBs and road works during peak hours. Bustops were “upgraded” to provide more shelter in exchange for longer walking distance and jamming of buses on a 2-lane street. The fact that the ECP website only launched around election period is very telling of how much they care. Maybe they have other great achievements, but I'm not feeling their impact.

This sounds very much like what OP mentioned about voting for opposition because I don't like what PAP has done (or not done), but imo there's nothing wrong with that.

How do I know opp won't be worse? Well... I don't. What I do know is nothing will change if we remain under PAP. Though I feel the same as many others in that opp generally seems more down-to-earth and better understand people's pain points.  The words they say can be understood and appreciated even by someone like myself.

Following OP's analogy, if I'm given an apple and an orange I've never tasted before + I know I already dislike the apple, I'll choose the orange on the off chance I end up liking it. Voting for opp is basically taking a risk in hopes that things will get better. The beauty of it is that the results are not permanent. If they win and I find nothing has improved, I'll simply vote against them in the next GE.

34. I am not looking at overturning the PAP as the ruling. I am looking at denying PAP a super majority so that they will not ignore and bulldoze us.

For an example, I do not agree with race based presidential elections. It is not democracy, not equality nor it is justice.

I also do not agree that Singapore is not ready for a non Chinese prime minister. I do not like it that PAP parented me to decide whether I am ready for a no. Chinese prime minister a not. 

I am more than ready and more than happy that Tharman can be my prime minister not my president.

35. For me the trigger why I don’t like PAP it’s the decade when they were pompous people saying they are elites and they know what’s best for us so they ignore all our feedback. 

I don’t hate them. But I dislike very much when someone pretends they know better when they don’t listen to the people on the ground.

36. If I was a voter in Jalan Kayu SMC, I’d vote WP coz fuck NCM.

37. My take is slightly different. Coming from a conviction/passion POV, what many ppl fail to realise is that the (respectable) oppo are fighting even when they don’t need to - and this is enough reason for me to vote them in, ahead of the passive/safe PAP yes-man/backbenchers in parliament who may not contribute to any meaningful inputs.

Point being many of the oppos have/could have had illustrious careers as lawyers, doctors. even the government scholars, or ex PAP members who have went to the other side. These ppl are doing it because they truly care, not because they got parachuted in or need the salary.

Even ppl like Lim Tean who is borderline unhinged, he was a successful lawyer but decided his calling for sg politics. or going further back like JBJ who basically fell from brilliant lawyer to bankruptcy after being sued, and they STILL fight. CSJ too for however unprofessional he was in the past, it takes passion/belief to continue fighting till today. And I don’t think you need to be particularly empathetic to be able to feel someone else’s genuine strong conviction/passion.

I know for a fact that new PAP mp in that grc/smc isn’t going to make any significant pushback/checks. On the flip slide, I believe the respectable oppo are passionate about real change, and therefore I am more inclined to vote these people in.

Long ago Socrates argued that the best people for public office are those who are motivated by a sense of duty and the desire to serve the common good.

38. >what makes you so sure WP wouldn’t do even worse? 

I wouldn't know. That's why track records help right?it's not a 2-week thing. We observe what they did over the past 5 years and decide. For new candidates, only time will tell. 

Which is why mentorship, candidate's demeanor, the party's manifesto and what they stand for as a party are important. 

It's like how you observe a person and decide whether you like this person or want to keep your distance from that person right? You may not always be right in your judgement, but actions generally are louder than words for you to make the judgement. And the observation doesn't stop at the end or because of the GE. It continues until that person decided not to be a politician. 

>After all opposition would do and say anything to win.

And yet, the lack of action from the PAP (the irony in the name TBH) is what saddens me. I admit that some ministers in PAP are legit good. They are competent and responsive. Since they're not in my constituency, I have to vote according to who I think I want to give it a try or keep the status quo right? TBH it's not even PAP against any party. It's more like it will apply to any party as long as dissatisfaction lingers in that 5 years. 

I don't quite agree with voting to keep it competitive but I understand the notion behind it (since it seems quite effective). Oh well, some may not agree to voting as a performance report like I do. To each his own.

39. I'll preface this by saying that I'm more likely to vote opposition because of the GRC system.

I live in what was once Bukit Batok SMC and had voted for Dr Chee during the by-elections. Unfortunately he could not garner sufficient votes and Mr Murali became my MP. However, Mr Murali has done well enough to have won my vote this coming election if only the SMC still existed.

Now, I don't get to choose my candidate - I have to choose a party instead. That is undemocratic and leaves a bad taste in my mouth - it's quite obvious that PAP/EBRC has robbed my SMC of fair representation to keep Dr Chee out of parliament.

I can't trust a party that behaves this way enough to vote for them willingly. However, my alternative is RDU which lolnothankyou.

40. You want to know the reason why?

The way they manage the estate. And I'm someone that lived in a PAP area but moved house to a WP area.

No joke brother. Day and Night.

In the PAP area, when my mum needed the Town Council to come and clear some debris, we were fortunate when it was cleared after a months time.

After moving to the WP area, we noticed a dead bird above the foyer. Mind you, just a dead bird. We called the Town Council, and they cleared it within the same day.....

The WP manages my area like their lives are on the line, and in the process improves my living environment.

My vote for them is a reward to continue the good work in managing my living estate area.
