Here are 40 Reddit comments explaining why Singaporeans support the opposition. Group them into 4–6 distinct motivations. For each group, give a short descriptive name, a 1–2 sentence summary, and 2–3 representative quotes (no need to clean grammar). Focus on themes, values, or frustrations expressed.

1. Not an outright opposition supporter but it’s the same reason why your procurement/finance ask you to get 3 bids from 3 different vendors.

When you know there’s someone else in the race, you run harder and faster.

2. I served as a grassroots leader for the last 5 years, and one of the rare ones who are not in the political party, even when they did ask. 

I too am on the fence, as over the years of serving as a grassroots leader (GRL) shows you the inner workings of how the constituency works (am also in CCC). I feel at times it’s just pandering to the MPs whims and fancies, doing stuff to give high visibility but not much real impact. For example, continually giving “welfare packs” to a rental block when clearly that rental block is over-welfared with multiple organisations doing the exact same thing, just because it’s easy and has great photo moments. 

I did raise up during meetings, and got branded as a troublemaker. 

And in the 5 years, I realise that the ruling party is mostly (though not all, but in this case, mine) about visibility rather than impact, about great photos rather than actual helping people who need help. 

I would VTO in a heartbeat - but the only crappy part is the opposition in my area is really disorganised and I’m unconvinced that they can’t represent us, add value to my life, or even speak up for policies. Looking at their manifesto and hearing their press releases don’t give me hope.

3. I refer you to the words of our current president Mr Tharman, who was then Finance Minister in 2011:

>"I think a strong opposition is good for the PAP, and for Singapore, as well."

and Mr George Yeo:

>"It is important to have a credible opposition so that should the PAP turn corrupt or become flaccid, there’s an alternative that Singaporeans can go for.”

4. On the fence, actually. 

There are good candidates on both sides, as there are bad ones.

Though, to me, if given a choice (mine’s a walkover this time) it’s either WP or PAP. Never the other parties, until they become more credible. 

If the PAP candidate is better, sure. If the WP candidate is better, sure. 

If both are equally good, it comes down to who is more on-the-ground in terms of behaviour.

5. I support the idea that we have to deny the PAP a super majority. Time and time again they have proven that they have only abused this power without any checks and balance.

E.g. reserved presidency, pofma used to silence critics, NTUC income.

6. 1. WP’s policies (while I don’t agree with all) lean closer to my own stance(s) and perspectives.

2. Historically, we know powers rise and fall. I’m voting the most credible opposition I see as insurance for the future. PAP was great, but lightning does not strike in the same place twice. If the opposition can have a steady growth, it ensures that there’s multiple avenues of leadership that can step up when the time calls for it.

3. I’m in Jalan Kayu and I’m extremely angry about NTUC income-Allianz. No. Just no. He doesn’t deserve power if he fucked up without being an MP imagine how much more he’ll mess up with more responsibilities.

7. As a former servant, I had to work under their hypocrisy for about a decade. I still work for an agency and am currently suffering under one unpopular minister whom I hope will be booted out. 


You know what ministers and MPs do? Everything is calculated to garner your votes. That includes covering up public fund wastage and not daring to report to you when certain public schemes have not achieved intended outcomes. They also waste public servants' time by parachuting in absolutely trashy permanent secretaries (few exceptions) and superscale officers who do nothing to improve the working lives of servants - people whom they have a direct impact on. You want me to trust them with governance of the country? They don't know the meaning of humanity if it slapped them in the face. 


If ministers truly cared about people and not votes, they would first look out for those who have to suffer implementing their last minute decrees with no proper resource planning and almost zero respect for governance. You are the ones who put up the red tape but you force us to skirt the red tape so voters like you more when you push initiatives out faster. When we get in trouble for it, where are you? Did you own up and say oh we skipped some steps cos I asked for it? Some minister even had the cheek to poke fun at the red tape we struggle to enforce. In public. Who cares about public servants' efforts to safeguard public funds? As long as this clown is standing in my GRC I will rather die than vote for him. 


I saw some 'popular' ministers who people think are very up there cos they seem to do a lot. Ask the people who work for them if you want the truth. Those are the people who have to near kill themselves and jump through hoops to do whatever the bigshot wants so that he can stay in power. At the expense of our families and physical and mental well being. 


I work for the public and the community and I separate it from whoever the minister is because I truly see nothing that they have contributed, only how they make my life difficult. I do see their blatant disregard for my colleagues' well-being, their disrespect of governance principles, policies and procedures, all to milk your favour. 


I don't see why anyone should vote to reward achievements of the past either. Just look at how HDB floor plans have evolved through the years. From a design that made sense to a design where I can only conclude that the government hates us. I don't even hate on the size - you can design it with privacy in mind so that I don't have to think about strangers being able to look in. I am not even talking about the price though I know it is really stressing everyone out. I bought my house under pressure without having the time to consider if it was OK because with every transaction, prices went up by 20k. Now I have to suffer with my crappy floorplan and 500k regret.


Lastly, PAP candidates were kind of rude and like 'who are u to tell me off for not following the rules'. I didn't even have to tell WP off cos they followed the rules. That's your typical PAP entitled behaviour that I'm used to. 


I cannot list the laundry list of things I know about the PAP that makes me hate them cos obviously OSA. But it is so bad that the only emotion I have when it comes to PAP is disgust, anger, hatred, and loathing. The perfect word is a malay word - menyampah. Compared to a zero feeling I have towards opposition, not difficult to vote against PAP. 

8. I know PAP will win anyway but I support opposition to keep PAP on their toes.

Make it competitive so regardless of whoever is in power, they will benefit the people more.

9. Cuz having opposition to "check" the ruling party makes sense to me

10. My thoughts. Not to start drama. 

I think the biggest issue for many people is how their "own" people will always be taken care of. And always it is by the tax payers or GLC/TLC linked companies. 

For example, NCM lost the election but somehow NTUC can come out and say that no need elected also can continue to be NTUC secgen. The 'ambrage' general can go and f up every corporation he goes to and still be posted to other cushy jobs. The multiple NTUC director postings and the list goes on. 

The entire machinery is fixed to support them where the person who lost the election can be appointed Grassroots advisor, WTF are they advising? PA allows usage of spaces and buildings paid for by taxpayers solely for PAP related events. Even opposition elected MPs have no right to use them. 

The fact that CCS can ask Pritam , " why you want to know?", despite the fact that he is faking elected. Basically questioning his intent and not so clearly saying he wanted to cause harm. 

The fact the LMW when he ask for a breakdown of stats can be scolded and put down in parliament.

It is the unfairness that the current blatantly displays that is causing so much ill feelings. 

If the average Singaporean is supposed to compete with the global talent then why these handpicked 皇亲国戚 can be protected to this magnitude? And funded mostly with tax payers monies. 

When the economy is good then it is because of brilliant leadership and governance, when things are not good then it is a global trend which they have no control over.

When they screw up then it is "let's move on" and when anyone else make a mistake then it is"please explain". 

There are so much more of these nonsense which I cannot even remember. 

I dun know cause I never study so much and comes from a not so good school. But the years of this nonsense builds up and of course people will look for an outlet. 

冰封三尺非一日之寒， when the snow is 3 feet high it is not due to 1 day of bad weather. My f up translation of the Chinese phase for my non Chinese speaking people. 

With the new 4G team I do not see any changes and the status quo seems to suit them fine. Of course it is fine when your senior civil servants and ministers are paid like bankers. Simi is GST? 

I rest my case.

11. Having lived with PAP & WP, opposition ward actually solved my issues in a timely manner instead of being dismissive and condescending. Light spoil, feed back, light fixed in 2 hours. Rat issues? Eradicated. Lift failure? No longer an issue. Parliament? Spoke up for us. 

That's why I vote WP. 

PAP didn't do anything in the 5 years they were in sengkang. Lilian Lee at least built Rivervale plaza. And she's just a single woman. All Charles Chong did was take 5 year MC on my tax monies. Louis Chua and sengkang GRC fixed lift issues, rat issues, light issues and fight for us in parliament.

12. Sg is becoming more like a place where only the overachievers/high achievers can live, and anyone else who prefers a slower or less competitive life, or is unable to attain a high achiever lifestyle will be replaced by the influx of foreigners. All in the pursuit of economic status and prestige for the country (but not necessarily its citizens). 

We have other asian nations whose culture is characterized by either very high stress and pressure and/or highly materialistic. I personally don't wish for either.

I highly doubt giving the incumbents a strong mandate to continue as they wish would result in any meaningful changes to these.

13. I think PAP's plan to grow the economy by increasing our population is not sustainable. 

Public transport:
If you try to take mrt during peak hours you can already see the system is almost maxed out (sometimes have to wait for a couple of trains to board). Can you imagine another 900k people fighting for public transport?

Competition in workforce:
Alot of the foreigners that are brought here are just to make us more competitive. The PMET jobs given can be done by us but yet they are given to foreigners who are cheaper or who are willing to OT more. It results in us having to compete with them by sacrificing family time to match their working hours. 

Statistics: 
When you watch the debates online, you will sometimes question if the stats provided by PAP are really true especially if you are on the ground. I feel PAP has this tendency to misrepresent stats to show that everything is working well when in fact it's the opposite.

14. because 'Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results' and I don't like the current results

15. i vote for the oppo because they are able to bring up questions of everyday citizens to the parliament. because i feel that PAP has been out of touch w the ground. You can look at the Ridout saga, NTUC-Allianz, rocketing hdb prices etc i feel that they see us as digits, work horses, to keep the whole Singapore inc going. many people are also brainwashed into fear by the PAP.

16. IMO, Having diverse views and representation is really important. I felt that many of the PAP people have really lost touch with the ground - many of the controversial statements made. 

Also, when there are issues, the sense is always about defending - the mentality of "we are PAP, WE ARE THE BEST AND WE CANNOT WE CANNOT BE WRONG"

17. I feel like questions like this are very misleading. Not intentionally (I presume), but because of the way many Singaporeans have been conditioned.

First of all, it assumes that voting for the PAP is the default. And you need a "reason" to vote for the opposition. There is no default state. Every party and candidate must earn my vote. 

Now that is clear, voting for the opposition, to me, offers a better vision than the PAP. Right now, I believe that is true. For the simple reason that having 90% of seats in parliament is completely against my interests. This has proven true on several occasions, with blatant disregard for the constitution.

Second, what does having 90% PAP MPs provide that 60% doesn't? Nothing. PAP forms the govt and passes all the legislation it needs to.

So it is very clear to me, unless I buy into the notion that the PAP can lose its majority, that voting for the opposition is in my interest (as long as I view them as credible). And I don't buy into the PAPs fear mongering of losing their majority.

So the PAP could hypothetically have had the most perfect and well governed 5 years (which it didn't, for the record) , and I still wouldn't give them 90% of Parliament.

18. I was 27 when I first tried for BTO. I tried for Tengah , didn’t get. I tried for Seng Kang subsequently, didn’t get. By the time I got my house (Tengah) last year, I was 34. Mind you I tried for non mature project each time. A kid could have completed a primary school education with the same time. It’s either I wait a long time for BTO or I spent a lot of money for resale. Even 4 room is close to 600k at Jurong West. BTO system is a relic of the past

I don’t have a kid even though I would have wanted to a few years ago 

Anyway, I am not looking to convince you since you are already leaning against opposition. I am just speaking for people of my age and my nieces and nephews. After all, people like me are just thorns in the minds of those living in their ivory towers

19. I believe that PAP does a good job and is underappreciated in many ways. Their strong suit is managing. They go for the obvious choices and solutions and move slowly on things. Call that being cautious. However, I noticed that PAP had very severe internal rot going on. They are good keeping the machine going but lack real creativity and/or direction. When speed is needed they are not agile enough to act on it and capitalise on opportunities. 

For example, regarding tax issues, they often see tax as the only way to be sustainable. However, everyone knows that our wealth fund makes quite a bit of money. In fact, half of the yearly budget comes from investment returns. Those who remember their economics will know that tax creates social costs and deadweight loss. Im sorry for those who didn't get to study this module. 

Tax is a way to balance the scale between the rich and poor We get that. But sometimes enough is enough. Im sure the government has the resources to think of ways to generate revenue. When the opposition proposes something, the first reaction for the PAP is to fix the opposition and not address the issue. It makes me very sick listening to the stupid things ministers say in parliament and on other occasions. It demonstrates that these MPs are out of touch with the ground and/or are just too full of themselves.

I believe our true wealth lies with our next generation, but government is so focused on numbers (GDP) that they rather drive singaporeans to death with long working hours than to legislate a fairer working hours for all so that we can have more time for family and kids. They are missing the forest for the trees. Yes, population issue is faced by most developed countries but we paid top dollar for ministers to solve issues and problems. We need some entrepreneurship and mental finesse here.

Opposition's role is to create rigorous intellectual competition with the incumbent, so that we as a nation can and will grow. If you want to be good, you need a friend, but if you want to be great, you definitely need an enemy. Yes many complained about weak oppositions, that is another topic - the PAP uses several methods to ensure that if you are opposition you are going to face a lot of difficulties, therefore resulting in a very small pool of talented people who want to be an opposition MP.

20. A single-party dominated polity is a dangerous one. This is because if there is a tilt towards autocracy or a dictatorship, there will be no bipartisan institutions and mechanisms in place to check the slide.

A two-party polity will mean that each side will always be supervised and watched, and this oversight will ensure that both parties will always be on their best behaviour and also doing their best. Mutual oversight and mutual competition will mean that ultimately, Singaporeans will benefit. (Please do not trot out the argument that the Government needs to be "strong" to execute policies - democracy necessarily requires that *what* policies ought to be pursued be settled first. We have the Third Reich and Gaddafi's Libya as haunting reminders of what might happen if "strong" is prioritised over democracy.)

I have no illusions that the WP will be "so much better" than the PAP, should the WP come to be the dominant party in Singapore. Ultimately, human nature is difficult to change. Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. To guard against this, and to mitigate the risks, it is important to have two political parties counterbalancing and offsetting each other.

Of late, I have seen the incumbent PAP sliding more towards an autocratic state, where they generally do not really care what the population they govern thinks. Nobody asked for POFMA, nobody asked for two successive GST hikes, nobody asked NTUC Income to be sold, nobody asked for the reserved Presidency, nobody asked for the redrawing electoral boundaries and the disappearing of certain SMCs. In my view, it is therefore an appropriate juncture for me to vote for the WP, to bring another political party more strongly into Parliament, so as to ensure that the PAP redirects its efforts to serve the country.

This is particularly the case when you witness the 'talent' that the PAP has been bringing (or attempting to bring) into its fold in recent years: Tan See Leng, Poh Li San, Gho Sze Kee, Ivan Lim, Marshall Lim, Alvin Tan, Lee Hui Ying etc. These people are far from the calibre that the country needs to run the country. In contrast, the WP has been fielding candidates that are increasingly credible (Harpreet Singh, for example, received his Senior Counsel accolade well before Edwin Tong). The time may be now to give them a chance.

21. Being majority means they have no restrictions changing constitution and electing their own president or redrawing election boundaries whenever they want.

If tomorrow they decide WP is a threat, nothing stops them from arresting WP leaders. It has been done with past political opponents before.

Absolute power corrupts, which is why check and balances are important.

22. Tbh the government in it's current state is extremely out of touch with the problems on the ground. It is saying enough sound bites to pacify people, but nothing concrete is being done. 

Housing is whack. I don't think I can ever afford public housing. 

Opportunities to really succeed. I can survive, but to thrive and be really happy? No. 

Cost of living. Just goes up and up. It's not sustainable. 

Suffocating rat race daily. 

Condescending MPs. Come on, I know you're busy, but to not even be able to put up an act for 10 minutes, and you're being paid too bro and sis. Can't you speak to my family and I better? Can you not dismiss us?

23. For me, it's what they did to amend the constitution for the Presidency. That's where I draw the line. It's one thing to adjust S377A as that's under the Penal Code but being able to unilaterally amend the highest law of the land is a big no from me.

I've always been leaning Opposition generally but this was the big one. Want to play around with Statutes depending on which side your party falls? Fine. But the constitution?

24. Only reasonable opposition are WP and PSP. Not a fan of LMW. Prefer WP because their short term goal is to form 1/3 of government for checks and balance

25. Would vote for oppo if oppo party have a reasonable strategy and if the specific PAP minister I don’t like.

26. As a gacha gamer let me use a gacha game example. 



Genshin impact was top dog in the market for years and began to stop listening to the players. Then came Wuthering Waves, a viable competitor that people began going to instead of Genshin. *Then, they started listening.*

27. the old guards of pap are long gone. many opposition candidates are better and more dedicated to the cause while pap candidates come from standardized backgrounds and are parachuted in on the coat-tails of 1 anchoring minister and the past accomplishments of the old guards.

28. Cos robust debate belongs in Parliament and not behind closed doors at PAP HQ.

29. simple because competition breeds growth

30. I dont have to talk about many issues, just one. Just read the timeline of the NTUC Income saga on Strait Times, and you will soon realize why there is pertinent need for checks and balance. The fact that this deal has been okayed by NTUC heads, spoken to the PAP's central committee and pedaled by other ministers in parliament WITHOUT bringing up the 1.85b capital reduction plan until the deal was already pre-agreed upon, is absolutely concerning. You could blame NTUC Income people (I do) for bringing this up in the first place, but how can it be so incompetent (or perhaps, on purpose) that this deal was agreed upon by the incumbent leadership?  
And now they want to field NCM as if nothing happened, and hope Singaporeans forgive him. 

I am not saying other opposition won't make similar mistakes, we are all human and we do. AND that's precisely why we need more opposition in parliament to act as a check and balance for EACH OTHER.

31. Unfortunately, I believe that old PAP's ideas and principles didn't quite translate to new PAP - this leads to issues like selling Income insurance. I would think this is normal. How can members who weren't there when these things were implemented remember them? But therein also lies the problem. 4g PAP seems untested and go against things I was comfortable with with old PAP. Hence, the need for checks and balances is more important now than ever. We cannot allow the new guards to change the systems that the old guards have set without careful deliberation.

32. From my circle, the predominant reason seems to be that:

1. WP's calibre is going up, while PAP's calibre is going down. 

2. PAP consistently sources candidates from a certain background/class which may very strong in certain aspects, but appears to lack in other aspects which affect the youth/working class primarily.  

3. Current policies favour the elite and rich significantly, at the expense of the rest of the working class.

4. Nothing lined up that gives working class and youths any hope that things will get better. Rather, it seems quite the opposite, that things will only get harder.

33. I used to work near Kovan, and often saw WP people dressed in their blue polo tees just sitting around the void decks of the blocks around there often. It left a strong impression in my mind because I feel that they are really present around the wards that they work in, even during non-election times. Like just any random regular working day of the week during lunch time, gathering around the tables at the void deck like regular folks. Unlike some other MPs that I've never seen before despite having lived in their area for 10+ years last time.

34. Just read and see the stark difference in both the manisfestos.

https://www.perplexity.ai/search/you-are-an-expert-in-singapore-krPVrYtdQXmu9lxhbq9gvA#0

35. It's the same reason why there are audits at work. Because without them, people would either slack off or start doing shady things.

36. I want a diversity of voices in parliament, not just to see the same people say yes to everything that someone proposes on their side.


WP MPs are incredibly hands-on and sincere about serving Singapore. I have seen this first hand myself as a volunteer.



With whatever that's been happening - Simplygo, MRT breakdowns (even with enhancements and maintenance), ERP 2.0, Allianz deal, Ridout etc, it is evident that the PAP is getting complacent in their governance.


Vote wisely, my friends. Every vote counts and makes a difference to Singapore.

37. This is exactly why I will support the opposition that will maintain the best policies and practices but still bring in new ideas and solutions.

The incumbent is so tone deaf, as long as the numbers are thrown out, statistics to show how our lives isn't terrible and all is well.

This is the problem with the incumbent. And what made Brexit and Trump possible. Because they don't listen, they don't empathise, they want to win the argument with logic. They think they are superior, know it all. 

But I don't need to be gaslighted into thinking the few hundred dollar vouchers will solve my problem. Their statistics are meaningless when I'm looking at my grocery receipts everyday and what used to buy me a trolley full of groceries now barely gets me half a trolley and barely covers a week. When every day I sit for lunch and a meal easily cost $5 or more. When I open my wallet and think about how to manage the cost of living when they announce a budget surplus after a 2% GST hike. When I look at the housing prices and worry for my child who may not be able to afford housing in his lifetime because the incumbent refuses to set housing firmly as a public good but let prices hit a million dollars. When I sit in a broken down mrt train listening to them tell me they don't want over maintenance. When I go to town on a weekend and I'm overwhelmed by the multitude of nationalities. When I want to genuinely support a legitimate and endorse a strong presidential candidate but get madame president instead. 

They keep telling me things are great and fine.  

But I'm done listening to them telling me it's fine when my lived reality hits different.

38. https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/s/9ZODXJ8AON

39. >I don't like XXX, so I'm voting opposition 

This is a valid opinion imo. The whole point of being an elected leader is that people like you and want you there. A capable manager who is an asshole is still gonna have people wanting them out. 

To turn around and tell those people that they are wrong or misguided for wanting the guy out simply because the next guy may not be much better, dismisses their current feelings.

In addition, you could say the same thing for some PAP supporters. They vote that way because they hate anyone who goes against their chosen party. Yet somehow we treat PAP supporters as morally or intellectually superior because of their choice?

The argument almost always centres around rationality. But what is rational to you may not be rational to me. Like, I don't think it's rational for any party to have a supermajority. I don't think it's rational that paternity leave hasn't been equalised with maternity leave. Yet, there are people out there, when met with the same points, who will absolutely think those things are rational.

40. The simplest way to find the answer is to go look back at the political history for the past 20 years. That should give you a vague idea. 

But to see the whole picture for comparison,you will need to dig into the origins of PAP and how it rose. 

Realized that the younger generation are truly unaware of the origins of the incumbent - they are no saints. Which explains why there is a saying of “fixing the opposition”.
