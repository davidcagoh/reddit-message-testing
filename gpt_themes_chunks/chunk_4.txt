Here are 40 Reddit comments explaining why Singaporeans support the opposition. Group them into 4–6 distinct motivations. For each group, give a short descriptive name, a 1–2 sentence summary, and 2–3 representative quotes (no need to clean grammar). Focus on themes, values, or frustrations expressed.

1. For my own interests of course!

2. [ Removed by Reddit ]

3. i’m in AMK GRC. i look left look right, no choice have to vote pap because they seem to be the only
competent choice.

4. Just to keep PAP grounded.

5. why not give opposition a chance to shake things up? Just ask yourself, are u happy with the standard of living of your life thus far? Your job, your house, your NS, your community u live in. IF u want change, u gonna make the change.

6. If you are updated on local news, I'm sick of PAP evading responsibility, talking down, making out of touch statements, fear mongering, gaslighting. Hiding statistics, using KPI which serves their purpose, neglecting the middle working class and mental health of the working class. The whole point of voting the opposition is not because of their manifesto, they do not have the backing and access of the entire civil to guide them in policy. They are here to question and keep the ruling party in check. 

Undeniably, there is group think in PAP. They are good administrators, no doubts about that. However, do they have a vision for Singapore ?

7. Did the PAP ever self reflect why so many haters if they think they're doing a good job for sporeans? They can win the battle but cannot win their heart.

8. I hear many reasons like hiking gst and housing becoming more and more unaffordable, but i bet these issues are a lot more complex and chronic than what most ppl think, in fact it’s a global problem. Voting WP won’t fix them i believe. 

Regarding check and balances as a reason, is it really helpful? Cause my first thought is, why try to change or risk changing something that is working well? Educate me.

9. 1) to keep PAP on their toes

2) I don’t like the ratio of foreigners at the moment

10. Uncomfortable with the super majority status in the parliament.

11. some of the reasons for me would be:

- def deny ruling party a supermajority. I did not like the GST changes for instance, and no amount of vouchers can convince me otherwise

- as a young voter, I think I am unfairly pitted against the elite and the rich factions of society. I see an uphill struggle, be it rising to a level of comfortability, or securing proper housing. I don't think the current ruling party is doing much to address this. I think we need more "socialist" policies, for the lack of a better word

- even if I vote for a "siaolang" oppo, my personal experience in living in both oppo and incumbent wards is that I've not felt the effects of which town council I'm staying in. so idt voting oppo, even the brain dead ones, is gonna cause my living experience to immediately go topsy turby in the unlikely event they are elected. worst case scenario, I just vote back PAP in the next election. but on the best case, I may attain a favorable outcome, in terms of policy, in terms of actions on the ground

- my GRC is one that had an "anchor MP" that got moved in like 2 to 3 days before election, and I definitely, don't appreciate that. if you wanna stand in my area, I want to have you seen your face for at least a year.

- oh one last thing I wanted to add, civil service salaries are absolute dog shit. I absolutely hate the fact that people who are working to serve for us, be it teachers, nurses, etc. are paid worse than ever? the fact that a teacher, unless he becomes senior management or something, cannot break 10k regardless of how hard he works, is just mind-boggling to me. and what do we have to blame? a materialistic, profit first government. other than salaries, career progression is also fked.

12. People here don't understand a few things.

1. The amount of foreign confidence other countries have because of the huge incumbent vote percentage. The moment that is significantly lowered, so will our branding of stability.

 2. Having more "voices" just for the sake of it will clip our wings for nimbleness amidst crisis. Look at how often the western government freezes just because there is a lock of opinions. People think that opposition will automatically vote sensibly while seriously disregarding the fact that opposition would as likely vote according to party lines as the incumbent. 

 3. Compared to global standards, even the current day govt with covid and trade, we are at the top 10%. To expect anybody without strong leadership experience to lead it will more likely vote in a worse leadership team than the current one. Basic risk vs reward. The reward to improve from 10% to 5% is much more unlikely as compared to dropping to below 20%. The moment that happens, parties will just vote for extremes such as the left and right in the west and we will always lose the stability forever.

 4. The more people hate incumbent and support oppo publicly, fewer talents will join the incumbent from all sectors - public, people and private. Afterall, why would people risk their lives, lose their privacy, get hatred and work 24/7 with zero job security, when they can get equal or more compensation at their current jobs? 

Its truly insane how much the support for opposition automatically comes for so many people. I understand when they are 18-20 but when people are 30 and still think like that, I worry for the future of sg. 

If you dislike the policies of the govt, vote oppo. If you dislike the policies of oppo, vote govt. Stop the I agree with govt but need check and balance nonsense.

Edit: grammar and phrasing.

13. Vote for a better retirement policy, when u are old surely u wont think like boomer of today as their HDB had rise 15 times.

Policy like labour insurance (it will seen as 2nd cpf), free healthcare above age of 75, using of medisave fully makes sense. BTO payback a portion at end of lease.

14. Because I don’t feel like the pap gives the people on the ground a voice.
If anything it feels like they are only for the rich and wealthy and foreigners. Because those are the people that can yield them mutual benefit the most.

15. Important to have an alternative voice so that the current situation of "u say wat wat" doesn't happen. The current nominated voice isn't sufficient, you see the nominated opposition get run over, questions are ignored, and there's no room for discussion at all. I don't want to see such, i want our voices to be heard. For that to happen, it can't be just tat few seats, it has to be significantly more. Therefore, as long as there're legit opposition. Will do everything to put that voice in there because if everyone thinks someone will do the job, we will continue to see comments such as: You voted them in. . . And the viscous cycle continues

16. Neutral party here. I feel why ppl support opposition is cause doesnt want one ruling party to make decision.

Like if you hear some rally speech, i heard WP's rally speech at Temasek JC. Like many opposition party, the issues raised are HDB, cost of living, GST etc.

These are all valid points. But in parliament whr PAP being the one who made the decision making, how can we be sure their decision is the correct one ? 

Just because they are from PAP ? I guess at the end, people are sick of a "i come out this policy, i implement the policy".

Not saying that there is no debate. But in the end when it comes to voting of implementing.... u know the outcome goes by majority. And who is the majority in parliament?

17. I feel the new PAP candidates are not so interested in serving, rather they were being asked to "do their duty".

 And the lack of magic being...You don't feel their conviction during their speeches and actions..whereas the opposition.. you can feel their convictions. Some oppositions...however convicted they are, they lack the ability to take on a role of MP and become jokers themselves.

Also PAP introducing new candidates and WP introducing new candidates is basically a new and clean slate for both sides. - both also equally and on par in terms of prestige I guess. The current PAP isn't the old PAP anymore. The old PAP did very well and were convicted in their actions. The old guards made this country what it is today. Don't forget they were once opposition too.

18. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. We cannot give so much power to one party and they can do everything unchecked - obscene salaries, useless mayors, no accountability, double standards (they can oppo can’t), all the blunders (NRIC, Income Allianz etc)

I don’t want a Singapore where we locals are marginalized as well. So yes. Opposition gets my vote

19. A lot of people seem to miss the point — there’s a big difference between constructive voices and those that are just disruptive for the sake of it. From the rallies so far, you can tell a lot of the opposition don’t really have solid or detailed proposals; mostly just shouting slogans without much depth. Some will say, "Go and read their manifestos lah," but honestly, most of it is just blanket statements without real thought on how to actually implement anything.

Sure, the incumbent party isn't perfect. they do screw up sometimes, and obviously no government is flawless. But if you think voting in more opposition MPs is magically going to solve everything overnight, that’s just wishful thinking. We need to be rational about it, not just vote based on emotion or temporary frustration. At the end of the day, it’s about who can realistically govern and plan properly for the long term, not just who can shout the loudest.

20. Because the ruling party is arrogant, elitist and out of touch. Seems to be the case since donkey years ago. Look at one of their elitist policies like the now defunct Graduate Mothers’ Scheme. So non-graduate mothers were viewed as “lesser mortals” back then? It was abolished not long after a public backlash.

21. The previous generation of PAP is long gone. How many comments have we heard from the PAP that simply betrays how the experience the world is not how we experience the world? I'm not even hating on them. I'm genuinely concerned that the PAP simply does not understand the struggle on the ground, what the average citizen has to deal with.

22. Too many bad policies imo, we need to challenge the incumbent so they remain people serving.

Best to train each party to be competent enough to lead this country in the future. Not saying PAP bad.

23. You don't remember the time when parliament filled with PAP Yes man and what they did to us now? I was born in 90s graduated with a poly cert, what does the future look for me?, work 25 years to afford a house while seeing your local high paying jobs being outsourced to an expat? what opportunities did the gov really provide? First world country but treated like 2nd class citizen. Serve national Duty 2 years NS,10-15 years reservist in the end just to get treated like this.

24. I hear so much about check and balances… help la this tagline was used since 2011!!! How has the opposition progressed since, what has been their report card? What have they truly checked and balanced? We should be talking about those.

25. Guys, the GST issue?? It collects from anyone looking to spend $$ in SG. INCLUDING FOREIGNERS. It's a math problem. Not that crazy. And they solved it by giving out free money to mitigate. I don't get the issue. Spend less and get taxed less, that's the principle of this tax. But yeah, we're collecting extra free $$ from tourists etc.

26. More opposition MPs makes the PAP better. And the PAP has no chance of losing the majority this election so they don't need more MPs.

27. pap has been only giving its 89% every other 5 years. i want them to give 200%. in order to do that, they need to feel threatened, awake , kan chiong and feel the pitch. to get that 200% that we will even benefit. 

it’s like how singtel was the only player until starhub and m1 came along. and now eight, circles, zero1, simba. they brought competition and that make everyone better. 

pap now is like mediacorp. there’s no competition. they think they are so good and great. they don’t listen to any one and have new ideas on how to be better. and because they are the only player, they can do whatever they want. that include doing shit content that no one care. that also include doing dirty means just to get halimah yacob become the president. 

personally i feel the whole system is flawed already. instead of debating and solving problems, in parliament its feels like classroom bickering and all being damn childish. and every ministers are just busy being a rockstar. taking over credit from every one who worked so hard, who worked on their script and yet they just become the guest of honour for all the events. we also often feel like we are being talked down. 

pap was an opposition party too. pap didn’t know how to be a government too. pap didn’t know how to run a town council too. everyone start somewhere. workers party founder david marshall was the first elected chief minister when lky was just merely in the opposition. david marshall then went on to start workers party after running for two years or so. the workers party weren’t nobody. and lky isn’t god. there’s goh keng swee, and the rest who was so good in what they do. but it seems lky was taking all the glory. 

whatever it is. every one sucks also. their speeches aren’t like lky. everyone is just reading the script not writing by themselves. things were not like before anymore. back then none for them stay in gcb. 

if they can just raise gst to 9% now without any contest or debate. they can also just raise to 20% in the future. with so much power, it’s very dangerous. 

singapore took the easy way out of raising gst. we are the only few countries amongst the world that does that during this hard times. israel and india is one of them. but india things are dirty cheap so that the increase doesn’t matter.

i want to worry not for myself but for our youth . it’s so hard to find a job, so stressful for this psle and flawed result driven education system. where tuition seems a must now. even if they work so hard, they will never get important big roles cause they are usually your ang mohs or reserved for president scholars from the army or not or something. and not to talk about bto or resale. it’s close to a million for resale now. and new citizens get favoured for the bto because their vote would be secured. while you are stuck with the resale that you probably cannot afford or take years to be in debt. 

if you ever work in the civil sector u will actually know the whole system is flawed also. damn slow. damn out of touch with the real world. and stupid solutions and suggestions. 

we just need to hire an estate manager to run the town council. like how condos are doing. why do we need politician to do that? a lot of mp aren’t speaking up. those who do. are party whipped or probably asked to leave. 

i am not against any politician who are running. but if its party before yourself then means pap mp have no voice and are just following pap order being a yes man. then what’s the point? hence the whole pap system is flawed. 

it’s not fun to be in singapore anymore. our hotels are shit high. tourists are complaining it’s expensive and boring. there’s nothing to do here other than to eat. many won’t come more than once. there’s no culture anymore. no music no movie no sports. it’s just work to pay your debt culture if any. there’s no more bookstores or many local brands. landlord are killing everyone with high rental. it’s not cool being here anymore. bangkok taipei seoul are doing so much more in the fun department. our orchard road is so dead. vietnam is so happening also. 

as such a rich nation, our citizen should generally be happy. but most aren’t. 

and all these needs to change. do u want your chicken rice and laksa to be $10? do u want the gst to be 20%?
