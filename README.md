# Reddit Message Testing: Political Discourse Analysis

## Project Overview

This project explores political discourse surrounding opposition support in Singapore by analyzing Reddit comments from the r/Singapore subreddit. The primary goal is to understand voter sentiment, identify key themes, and test message effectiveness using NLP techniques.

Given that Singapore has compulsory voting, understanding the nuances of voter sentiment is crucial for campaigns that rely on persuasion rather than turnout. This project attempts to extract thematic and sentiment insights from Reddit discussions about political support.

## Folder Structure

The project has the following folder structure to organize the data, code, and outputs:
	•	gpt_themes_chunks/: This folder contains the Python scripts responsible for chunking the Reddit comments and processing them with GPT.
	•	gpt_themes_outputs/: This folder contains the outputs generated by GPT after processing the chunks of comments. The results are used for further analysis and are stored in text files.
	•	filtered_comments.json: This file contains the Reddit comments that have been filtered for analysis. It serves as the primary input for processing.

## Methods Tried

The analysis of the Reddit comments used several techniques, including NLP and GPT-based approaches, to uncover underlying patterns and key themes:
	•	NLP Techniques (KeyBERT & BERTopic): Initial attempts using KeyBERT and BERTopic did not provide satisfactory results, as they struggled with the messy, nuanced, and slang-filled nature of r/Singapore comments.
	•	GPT-based Chunking: Splitting the comment data into smaller chunks and using GPT to process them yielded the best results. GPT was able to capture clearer insights into voter sentiment by generating coherent themes from smaller, more manageable datasets.

## Lessons Learned
	•	NLP Models: Common NLP models like KeyBERT and BERTopic struggled to accurately identify themes in messy, highly nuanced, and slang-laden text, which is characteristic of Reddit discussions.
	•	Chunking for GPT: Breaking the dataset into smaller chunks made it possible for GPT to process and provide coherent, useful insights, which proved more effective than other NLP approaches.
	•	Human Verification: While GPT-generated results were useful, manual verification and interpretation were essential to ensure the relevance and clarity of the extracted themes.

## Label Summary

The final labeled dataset categorizes Reddit comments into six key themes: 'Check and Balance', 'PAP Conduct', 'Policy Gaps',
    'Credible Opposition', 'Political Pluralism', 'Grounded Opposition'. See `summary_table.md` for the full breakdown of comment counts and upvote totals by label.
