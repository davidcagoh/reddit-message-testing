        "text": "As a former servant, I had to work under their hypocrisy for about a decade. I still work for an agency and am currently suffering under one unpopular minister whom I hope will be booted out.\u00a0\n\n\nYou know what ministers and MPs do? Everything is calculated to garner your votes. That includes covering up public fund wastage and not daring to report to you when certain public schemes have not achieved intended outcomes. They also waste public servants' time by parachuting in absolutely trashy permanent secretaries (few exceptions) and superscale officers who do nothing to improve the working lives of servants - people whom they have a direct impact on. You want me to trust them with governance of the country? They don't know the meaning of humanity if it slapped them in the face.\u00a0\n\n\nIf ministers truly cared about people and not votes, they would first look out for those who have to suffer implementing their last minute decrees with no proper resource planning and almost zero respect for governance. You are the ones who put up the red tape but you force us to skirt the red tape so voters like you more when you push initiatives out faster. When we get in trouble for it, where are you? Did you own up and say oh we skipped some steps cos I asked for it? Some minister even had the cheek to poke fun at the red tape we struggle to enforce. In public. Who cares about public servants' efforts to safeguard public funds? As long as this clown is standing in my GRC I will rather die than vote for him.\u00a0\n\n\nI saw some 'popular' ministers who people think are very up there cos they seem to do a lot. Ask the people who work for them if you want the truth. Those are the people who have to near kill themselves and jump through hoops to do whatever the bigshot wants so that he can stay in power. At the expense of our families and physical and mental well being.\u00a0\n\n\nI work for the public and the community and I separate it from whoever the minister is because I truly see nothing that they have contributed, only how they make my life difficult. I do see their blatant disregard for my colleagues' well-being, their disrespect of governance principles, policies and procedures, all to milk your favour.\u00a0\n\n\nI don't see why anyone should vote to reward achievements of the past either. Just look at how HDB floor plans have evolved through the years. From a design that made sense to a design where I can only conclude that the government hates us. I don't even hate on the size - you can design it with privacy in mind so that I don't have to think about strangers being able to look in. I am not even talking about the price though I know it is really stressing everyone out. I bought my house under pressure without having the time to consider if it was OK because with every transaction, prices went up by 20k. Now I have to suffer with my crappy floorplan and 500k regret.\n\n\nLastly, PAP candidates were kind of rude and like 'who are u to tell me off for not following the rules'. I didn't even have to tell WP off cos they followed the rules. That's your typical PAP entitled behaviour that I'm used to.\u00a0\n\n\nI cannot list the laundry list of things I know about the PAP that makes me hate them cos obviously OSA. But it is so bad that the only emotion I have when it comes to PAP is disgust, anger, hatred, and loathing. The perfect word is a malay word - menyampah. Compared to a zero feeling I have towards opposition, not difficult to vote against PAP.\u00a0",

And always it is by the tax payers or GLC/TLC linked companies. \n\nFor example, NCM lost the election but somehow NTUC can come out and say that no need elected also can continue to be NTUC secgen. The 'ambrage' general can go and f up every corporation he goes to and still be posted to other cushy jobs. The multiple NTUC director postings and the list goes on. \n\nThe entire machinery is fixed to support them where the person who lost the election can be appointed Grassroots advisor, WTF are they advising? PA allows usage of spaces and buildings paid for by taxpayers solely for PAP related events. Even opposition elected MPs have no right to use them. \n\nThe fact that CCS can ask Pritam , \" why you want to know?\", despite the fact that he is faking elected. Basically questioning his intent and not so clearly saying he wanted to cause harm. \n\nThe fact the LMW when he ask for a breakdown of stats can be scolded and put down in parliament.\n\nIt is the unfairness that the current blatantly displays that is causing so much ill feelings. \n\nIf the average Singaporean is supposed to compete with the global talent then why these handpicked \u7687\u4eb2\u56fd\u621a can be protected to this magnitude? And funded mostly with tax payers monies. \n\nWhen the economy is good then it is because of brilliant leadership and governance, when things are not good then it is a global trend which they have no control over.\n\nWhen they screw up then it is \"let's move on\" and when anyone else make a mistake then it is\"please explain\". \n\nThere are so much more of these nonsense which I cannot even remember. \n\nI dun know cause I never study so much and comes from a not so good school. But the years of this nonsense builds up and of course people will look for an outlet. \n\n\u51b0\u5c01\u4e09\u5c3a\u975e\u4e00\u65e5\u4e4b\u5bd2\uff0c when the snow is 3 feet high it is not due to 1 day of bad weather.

And you need a \"reason\" to vote for the opposition. There is no default state. Every party and candidate must earn my vote. \n\nNow that is clear, voting for the opposition, to me, offers a better vision than the PAP. Right now, I believe that is true. For the simple reason that having 90% of seats in parliament is completely against my interests. This has proven true on several occasions, with blatant disregard for the constitution.\n\nSecond, what does having 90% PAP MPs provide that 60% doesn't? Nothing. PAP forms the govt and passes all the legislation it needs to.\n\nSo it is very clear to me, unless I buy into the notion that the PAP can lose its majority, that voting for the opposition is in my interest (as long as I view them as credible). And I don't buy into the PAPs fear mongering of losing their majority.\n\nSo the PAP could hypothetically have had the most perfect and well governed 5 years (which it didn't, for the record) , and I still wouldn't give them 90% of Parliament.",

Call that being cautious. However, I noticed that PAP had very severe internal rot going on. They are good keeping the machine going but lack real creativity and/or direction. When speed is needed they are not agile enough to act on it and capitalise on opportunities. \n\nFor example, regarding tax issues, they often see tax as the only way to be sustainable. However, everyone knows that our wealth fund makes quite a bit of money. In fact, half of the yearly budget comes from investment returns. Those who remember their economics will know that tax creates social costs and deadweight loss. Im sorry for those who didn't get to study this module. \n\nTax is a way to balance the scale between the rich and poor We get that. But sometimes enough is enough. Im sure the government has the resources to think of ways to generate revenue. When the opposition proposes something, the first reaction for the PAP is to fix the opposition and not address the issue. It makes me very sick listening to the stupid things ministers say in parliament and on other occasions. It demonstrates that these MPs are out of touch with the ground and/or are just too full of themselves.\n\nI believe our true wealth lies with our next generation, but government is so focused on numbers (GDP) that they rather drive singaporeans to death with long working hours than to legislate a fairer working hours for all so that we can have more time for family and kids. They are missing the forest for the trees. Yes, population issue is faced by most developed countries but we paid top dollar for ministers to solve issues and problems. We need some entrepreneurship and mental finesse here.\n\nOpposition's role is to create rigorous intellectual competition with the incumbent, so that we as a nation can and will grow. If you want to be good, you need a friend, but if you want to be great, you definitely need an enemy. Yes many complained about weak oppositions, that is another topic - the PAP uses several methods to ensure that if you are opposition you are going to face a lot of difficulties, therefore resulting in a very small pool of talented people who want to be an opposition MP.",

This is because if there is a tilt towards autocracy or a dictatorship, there will be no bipartisan institutions and mechanisms in place to check the slide.\n\nA two-party polity will mean that each side will always be supervised and watched, and this oversight will ensure that both parties will always be on their best behaviour and also doing their best. Mutual oversight and mutual competition will mean that ultimately, Singaporeans will benefit. (Please do not trot out the argument that the Government needs to be \"strong\" to execute policies - democracy necessarily requires that *what* policies ought to be pursued be settled first. We have the Third Reich and Gaddafi's Libya as haunting reminders of what might happen if \"strong\" is prioritised over democracy.)\n\nI have no illusions that the WP will be \"so much better\" than the PAP, should the WP come to be the dominant party in Singapore. Ultimately, human nature is difficult to change. Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. To guard against this, and to mitigate the risks, it is important to have two political parties counterbalancing and offsetting each other.\n\nOf late, I have seen the incumbent PAP sliding more towards an autocratic state, where they generally do not really care what the population they govern thinks. Nobody asked for POFMA, nobody asked for two successive GST hikes, nobody asked NTUC Income to be sold, nobody asked for the reserved Presidency, nobody asked for the redrawing electoral boundaries and the disappearing of certain SMCs. In my view, it is therefore an appropriate juncture for me to vote for the WP, to bring another political party more strongly into Parliament, so as to ensure that the PAP redirects its efforts to serve the country.\n\nThis is particularly the case when you witness the 'talent' that the PAP has been bringing (or attempting to bring) into its fold in recent years: Tan See Leng, Poh Li San, Gho Sze Kee, Ivan Lim, Marshall Lim, Alvin Tan, Lee Hui Ying etc. These people are far from the calibre that the country needs to run the country.

You could blame NTUC Income people (I do) for bringing this up in the first place, but how can it be so incompetent (or perhaps, on purpose) that this deal was agreed upon by the incumbent leadership?  \nAnd now they want to field NCM as if nothing happened, and hope Singaporeans forgive him. \n\nI am not saying other opposition won't make similar mistakes, we are all human and we do. AND that's precisely why we need more opposition in parliament to act as a check and balance for EACH OTHER.",

Hence, the need for checks and balances is more important now than ever. We cannot allow the new guards to change the systems that the old guards have set without careful deliberation.",

        "text": "Here's my attempt to answer your questions, even though these points have already been brought up time and time again by the WP and other opposition parties. I apologise for the long post. \n\n1. An opposition functions as a check and balance on the ruling party. Without elected opposition MPs in Parliament, how exactly do you expect the ruling party to be kept in check? Does the PAP need 97/97 seats to function? No. But having a sizeable opposition presence allows for constructive debates in Parliament on alternative policy ideas as well as the drawbacks and tradeoffs of policies that PAP seeks to implement, so that the public is kept informed. And the WP has been functioning as that check and balance for years now and 4 out of the top 5 MPs that filed the most PQs and participated the most in Parliamentary debates were from the WP. \n\n2. Constitutional amendments can only be passed with a 2/3 majority in Parliament. All other decisions can be passed with a simple majority. Why? Because the constitution is the highest law of the land. The fact that the PAP can, and has, amended the Constitution so many times despite public disapproval should be a cause of concern. The most controversial amendment passed in recent memory is the amendment of the Constitution to reserve the Presidency for a minority candidate. Even minorities were opposed to this, as it reeks of tokenism. Minorities want to be elected on merits too. And the amendments only effectively prevented the then very popular TCB from contesting the elections. Another controversial amendment is the introduction of the NCMP scheme, where non-elected losing candidates have rights to vote on important legislation. How is this democratic? Which is why, for years, opposition parties have been asking for Singaporeans to deny the PAP a 2/3 majority. In every other democratic society, having more than 60 out of 97 seats in Parliament would be considered a great victory. \n\n3. A large opposition party with resources and members that has the ability to form a shadow Cabinet cannot form out of thin air. It has to develop over time. And the closest we have to a credible, alternative party other than the PAP is the WP because it has won the most seats of any opposition party. The WP is volunteer driven at its core. It does not have a large policy team. And yet, time and time again, they have come up with alternative policy ideas and pathways to implementation. They are not throwing shit at the PAP or at our civil service and criticising for the sake of criticising. They know Singaporeans expect practical, feasible policies and that is exactly what they have been trying to come up with. Some may be good, some may be bad but in a democracy, you debate and you compromise and eventually, you reach a landing that works for all stakeholders. Not have one party dominate all discussions.\n\n4. The ones doing the actual work is not the PAP. It is our civil service, which is supposed to be apolitical. But because they work for the Government of the day and the PAP has been the Government all these years, the civil service is often seen as intertwined with the PAP. But the civil service is made up of exemplary, hardworking individuals and is the biggest resource at the disposal of the PAP. They are the ones coming up with policy ideas and they are the ones working behind the scenes and consulting stakeholders to find out what works, what are the trade-offs etc. These are the people who deserve the credit, not the PAP. But that doesn't mean the civil service doesn't have blind spots because they are simply following their boss's instructions. They work on a particular ideology. The role of an opposition is to help identify these blindspots that may be missed because of group think. \n\n5. Ironically, the party that continually harps on us being in a crisis is the PAP. They tell us Singapore is entering turbulent waters and they need a strong mandate to govern. The opposition tells you that Singapore will be better off with them checking on the PAP even as we enter these turbulent waters. It is up to you to decide which you agree with. And while you may be privileged enough to not feel it, there are groups of people in Singapore that are impacted by high cost of living (it is a crisis for them) and housing affordability (it is a crisis for singles). \n\nIn short, the answer to your question is, if you don't try, you will never know. The WP is the only opposition party that has successfully run town councils over multiple terms and is the only party that has proved its worth in Parliament. It is Singapore's best chance at allowing a credible alternative to develop. Them losing seats will be a setback for democracy in Singapore, in my opinion. But I do respect the alternative view which is that PAP has a good system of internal checks and balance, has offered Singaporeans stability for years and may operate best when it has an extremely strong mandate.",

Lee Kuan Yew had a history of imprisoning his political rivals without a trial, where they were treated extremely inhumanly, and later on, when that wasn\u2019t as easy anymore, dragging them into the court to bankrupt them. He went on to remove the Law Society\u2019s ability to stop the courts from being abused, etc. The current generation of PAP leaders have shown that they\u2019re perfectly willing to create laws to do similar things, such as POFMA. There may be no equivalent to ISD today, but there doesn\u2019t need to be. Just make a law, and then fuck people over with it if they dare dissent. \n\nAll the checks and balances that existed in the past to prevent the PAP from abusing their power have been removed. The *only* thing left is voting, and they gerrymander the shit out of it every god damn election. The media is controlled by the state. The PAP withheld quality of life upgrades that should have been given out to every citizen, which is basically blackmail. They may not be doing it now, but there hasn\u2019t been much effort to dispel that notion. The pervasive belief that your job in the civil service is dependent on you voting the PAP continues to live on. I wish they would just come out and say it explicitly, that your civil service job would not be affected at all by voting opposition, but I suppose it benefits the incumbent to let that belief stay.\n\nThe fact that they\u2019ve built this cult of personality around LKY is just the shitty icing on the cake really. The whole narrative around the sleepy fishing village, third world to first blah blah blah, all so that they can whore out his memory to get people to vote for them\u2026 it\u2019s pathetic. And kinda disgusting. It benefits them to gloss over all his wrongs because he\u2019s basically worshipped; for all the emphasis on how LKY didn\u2019t want his house to become a shrine, it\u2019s funny that the people who keep parroting that are the ones who very much revere him and treat his word as law. So much for not wanting to be deified.\n\nAnd so they continue hoarding power, paying themselves exorbitant salaries, implying that it\u2019ll somehow prevent corruption, all while refusing to define a poverty line and implement minimum wages. Didn\u2019t work for Iswaran, did it? So should we pay them even more then?\n\nIn the words of Sylvia Lim, they\u2019re little more than \u201cmercenaries at the helm\u201d, wielding their absolute power to maintain their chokehold on us.",

For instance, in September 2021, during a parliamentary debate on jobs and foreign worker policies, Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan was caught on a hot mic referring to Progress Singapore Party NCMP Leong Mun Wai as \u201cilliterate\u201d and questioning how he got into Raffles Institution, adding, \u201cMust have been a lousy school.\u201d  Despite public backlash and calls for accountability, Dr. Balakrishnan remained in his position, raising questions about whether such attitudes truly represent the values of everyday Singaporeans.\n\nSupporting the opposition is crucial because it helps keep the PAP in check.

For them, they are a beneficiary of a right-leaning pro business system in which the incumbent built from ground up but now want to bite the hand that fed them - it really doesn't make much sense.\n\nYou can refer to the singapore thread:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/s/NFERc9iMky](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/s/NFERc9iMky)\n\nLook at the comments on like - \n\n1. only tax landed property, but not 1M HDB flats (then now why are you reducing the avenue of taxation then?)\n\n2. as long as I'm not the tax bracket that is affected, its fine with me. (so now what happens if it affects you. are you going to swing to the incumbent? I'm going to expect ALOT of elephants in the room already once WP's policies do not benefit you)\n\nThis is irony at its finest and the same feminism crap debate THAT is still going on - people only want to cherry pick their wins and refuse to accept any drawbacks. And this is the true elephant in the room, in which people refuse to admit they only want policies for their selfish gain and will gladly swing themselves to other side once they aren't a beneficiary of a system.\n\n  \nSo what you are missing here is because the surface level arguments are too muddied and circular in nature - dig past the surface and you will see only self-interest wrapped in abstract justifications.\n\nHowever, I'd like to highlight that this is not representative of the other branch of folks that need to lean left (for political, economic, social, cultural, reasons) - there is a deeply rooted justification and I'm all for it.\n\n  \nSo with that out of the way, lets get back to the question on \"what exactly are you voting opposition for?\"\n\nIn a system that benefits a class of individuals and that one is not a true beneficiary of - obviously one would like to push for left wing ideologies in a deeply rooted right leaning dominant system - think of the slightly less skilled folks who are 1 layoff away from financial trouble or because the floodgates were open for external employment in which wages are depressed. Or perhaps those individuals that want a more open left ideology related to gender fluidity, acceptng other woke cultural norms, etc. Or even specific sagas that left bright folks thrown under the bus (the bio sector push in the early 2010s, but the govt bailed out eventually - so think of the straight A student entering uni with a bioengg degree under the govt's empty promises and essentially received early carerr suicide. we can go on here but you get the gist.\n\nso its my opinion here - but we should all look into the ideologies behind a polititcal system (left vs right) and then stand by it in a principled way. Its really not so much on the circular reasoning, the checks and balances or deny the super majority, or the selfish mindset of \"whats in it for me\". \n\n(altho i do know that this wont happen. thats why we always call society a sinkie pwn sinkie mentality.)",

Bustops were \u201cupgraded\u201d to provide more shelter in exchange for longer walking distance and jamming of buses on a 2-lane street. The fact that the ECP website only launched around election period is very telling of how much they care.

Well... I don't. What I do know is nothing will change if we remain under PAP. Though I feel the same as many others in that opp generally seems more down-to-earth and better understand people's pain points.  The words they say can be understood and appreciated even by someone like myself.\n\nFollowing OP's analogy, if I'm given an apple and an orange I've never tasted before + I know I already dislike the apple, I'll choose the orange on the off chance I end up liking it. Voting for opp is basically taking a risk in hopes that things will get better. The beauty of it is that the results are not permanent.

These ppl are doing it because they truly care, not because they got parachuted in or need the salary.\n\nEven ppl like Lim Tean who is borderline unhinged, he was a successful lawyer but decided his calling for sg politics. or going further back like JBJ who basically fell from brilliant lawyer to bankruptcy after being sued, and they STILL fight.

It was for an entry level role that some of my well-qualified uni mates applied for and got rejected. Do a proper search on LinkedIn and you'll find many other similar examples.",

        "text": "my 2 cents take on the matter:\n\nIm on the fence with both. PAP is good but can be better. Opposition meanwhile, (ok for simplicity's sake, lets mainly consider SDP PSP and WP), is also good, however so far as far as i can see doesn't have many super convincing individuals that will instantly make me \"ok let's vote for oppo in\". A few reasons regarding this stance:\n\n* Many people, including opposition parties, have been harping on the 2% gst increase. Rough calculations based off the budget 2025 at least, suggests that the 2% gst is indeed actually effectively offset using the vouchers. In fact, more than that is actually covered, depending on your spending power (the lower, the higher the subsidy/ set off) etc. Ok hear me out ah, based off google summary at least: In 2023, the average Singaporean household spent $5,931 monthly. This translates to 71,172 annual, and a 2% increase roughly translates out to 1423 per yr ish. However, lets check the budget 2025.  \n   1. Sg60 vouchers 600\n   2. Assurance package 100-600\n   3. GST voucher scheme 450 - 850\n   4. Culture pass 100\n   5. Activesg 100\n   6. Personal income tax rebate 0-200\n   7. CDC vouchers 800\n   8. U-save 440 - 760\n   9. s&cc rebate 1.5-3.5 months offset\n   10. climate vouchers 400\n* So, u are getting anywhere from 2990 minimum up to 4k+, and this covers way more than the median household increment they would face from 2% GST. If we only look at pure cash they give straight up (so exclude rebate, climate vouchers etc), 800 + 600 + 100 (CDC voucher + sg60 voucher + minimum from AP), and its alr more than 1400. Shit on PAP all you want, but lets give credit where its due: They really did offset the 2% increase for at least 50% of the populace, and for the rest, come on la, you are already earning more than the rest, and you spend way more on non-necessities, not really PAP's fault liao right? PAP did highlight this increase has been delayed for quite some time (Even back in 2012, there was talks of increasing GST to 10%, although this was met with immense backlash), and now they cannot put it off any longer in view of an ageing population and needing more funds to tackle this. Unpopular opinion, but i cannot find fault with this logic at all. \n\n* What i can however find fault with, is the fact that inflation is rather high. The number in % doesn't seem a lot, but the trickle-down effects is very much present in our everyday expenses. Pre COVID i rmb my avg cai fan being like 4-4.50 max, now its like 5-5.50 (wtf?) in my area. Yeah, its not that i dont understand its due to factors p much outside PAP's control, however, they can definitely do better in this regard, in mitigating the effects at least.",

This in the long-run will result in organizational inefficiency and stagnation, which I actually do see within certain civil service branches. Any system that does not evolve will be left behind, as we have seen with many of the old-gen \"famous\" local companies (e.g. Hin Leong's lack of proper risk management)\n\nOn the other hand, WP candidates overall seem competent and eager to prove their worth and willing to question existing status quo for improvement. I believe that this is good for any well functioning organization. Sadly, I find it hard to say the same for most other opposition parties. \n\nOn specifically housing affordability, \n\nWP's manifesto kind of addresses it in a mild-way with the overarching message that houses are meant for Singaporeans to stay in, instead of being seen as a safe haven investment. I agree with the message but not the implementation steps, which I feel could be more forceful (probably to err on side of caution with voters). \n\nTried and tested ways of making investment properties less attractive could include taxing rental income / capital gains on non-owner occupied properties, increasing property tax for non-owner occupied properties significantly or even like a hefty estate tax on non-owner occupied properties.",

Its bloody tough being the opposition, and the PAP purposely makes it ridiculously tough, yet they still chose to be opposition and work extra hard for their passions.\n\non the other hand, look at some of these people living in their civil service bubble, being parachuted in from god knows where. The system makes it super easy for them to get in (just get into a GRC with SMLee or LW or shan) and they can literally cruise their way into parliament without any accountability. Just do what the party wants you to do, collect a nice pay, dont rock the boat, and even working hard for the residents is optional. These people will barely work for you and couldnt give two shits about your wellbeing, for them its all about prestige and money rather than pure passion.\n\nI like WP because I have a neat ability to see right through peoples intentions and I can sniff a snake from miles away. WP people have always been genuine and have walked the talk. And thats why I like them more because theyre much more relatable than the rigid robots in white.",

I see an uphill struggle, be it rising to a level of comfortability, or securing proper housing. I don't think the current ruling party is doing much to address this. I think we need more \"socialist\" policies, for the lack of a better word\n\n- even if I vote for a \"siaolang\" oppo, my personal experience in living in both oppo and incumbent wards is that I've not felt the effects of which town council I'm staying in. so idt voting oppo, even the brain dead ones, is gonna cause my living experience to immediately go topsy turby in the unlikely event they are elected. worst case scenario, I just vote back PAP in the next election. but on the best case, I may attain a favorable outcome, in terms of policy, in terms of actions on the ground\n\n- my GRC is one that had an \"anchor MP\" that got moved in like 2 to 3 days before election, and I definitely, don't appreciate that. if you wanna stand in my area, I want to have you seen your face for at least a year.\n\n- oh one last thing I wanted to add, civil service salaries are absolute dog shit. I absolutely hate the fact that people who are working to serve for us, be it teachers, nurses, etc. are paid worse than ever? the fact that a teacher, unless he becomes senior management or something, cannot break 10k regardless of how hard he works, is just mind-boggling to me. and what do we have to blame? a materialistic, profit first government. other than salaries, career progression is also fked.",

Look at how often the western government freezes just because there is a lock of opinions.

Compared to global standards, even the current day govt with covid and trade, we are at the top 10%. To expect anybody without strong leadership experience to lead it will more likely vote in a worse leadership team than the current one. Basic risk vs reward. The reward to improve from 10% to 5% is much more unlikely as compared to dropping to below 20%. The moment that happens, parties will just vote for extremes such as the left and right in the west and we will always lose the stability forever.\n\n 4. The more people hate incumbent and support oppo publicly, fewer talents will join the incumbent from all sectors - public, people and private. Afterall, why would people risk their lives, lose their privacy, get hatred and work 24/7 with zero job security, when they can get equal or more compensation at their current jobs? \n\nIts truly insane how much the support for opposition automatically comes for so many people.

TSL mentioned foreign MNCs usually want someone in their trusted people to work in the company, the china MNC hires a lot of people from China is understandable, but the US MNC hires a lot of people from India.\n\n3. Don't expect those pmet will teach Singaporeans in the workforce, unless they are going retired it will move somewhere else and have a better opportunity. For example if people from India or china come to Singapore to work, do you think they want to go back to their home country where they will earn much less than in Singapore? Also most will not say, but hint if you want to learn then go back to school or go attend course.\n\n4.lastky I want to advise that Singaporeans cannot find a job and have the business ideas and got the skill to make the product or service, go make a startup, there are sg founder grant, tech startup grant or whatever, also school like NUS,NTU can help to train more about enterpurship skill, company accounting etc.",

Vote someone who is eloquent and can articulate well to bring your issues across. Don't blindly follow a party. \n\nFrom my POV, in Singapore, ministries can function without a minister but not vice versa. A number of our ministers are figureheads that have certain leadership qualities that make it so they can represent any ministry and it wouldn't make a difference. These are the anchors appointed in PAP strongholds, and more often than not, they're the usual suspects on the receiving end of an embarrassing debate.\n\nEDIT: So I don't think I'm pro-opposition or PAP, I'll just vote for the candidate that can best represent me(or us) in parliament.

But with mulitpartisanship, there's 2 versions (definitely more, but I'll be simplifying it)\n\n1) US' bipartisan RIVALRY\n2) Proper multipartisan democracy\n\nWe are heading towards the US' version, a shitshow. You know this when people say \"Vote Opposition\" instead of any single party. Just voting any opposition so we have more voices in Parliament is a dangerous way to vote, because it ensures that it is PAP vs Opposition, which will devolve to smear campaigns as we've already seen. It's the easiest way for the Opposition to win brownie points, and the easiest way for PAP to scare the fence sitters away from the Opposition. It becomes a rat race to the finish line, where how you win doesn't matter, as long as you win.\n\nInstead, we should be voting for policies. Whichever party has objectively better policies should be the ones voted in. That way, policymaking becomes the focus. There will be healthy competition, and better policies being born of it.\n\nThat's why I will never agree with the idea of voting the opposition in just to have differing voices in Parliament. The differing voice needs to at least have substance. If you agree with the policies of the Opposition (WP does have really good policies), you feel that a party's MP will better represent you in Parliament, or if you feel that a party's MP has more presence in your constituency, vote for them and power to you. But if all you can say is \"vote anyone but PAP\" or \"vote any opposition so that we have opposing voices in Parliament\", then you're actively causing Singapore to slowly slide towards the circus that US politics is.",

Is it to vote for the party with the best candidates in each GRC, or to vote based on the meta where more people voting for oppo signals displeasure on the ground, no matter how competent or incompetent the opposition is. **Should voting be about choosing the best person for the job, or about sending a message?** What if both decisions are in conflict? That's the dilemma of our current voting system.\n\nThe incumbent will naturally favor a system that keeps one party perpetually in power. There are legitimate reasons why this might be good if you believe that too many parties in power can lead to ineffective governance. However, the current system also favors a winner-takes all approach, where the incumbent only needs 51% of votes in each constituent to win all the seats. This unfairly silences the voices of people with discontent. Solutions like ranked choice voting might mitigate some of these problems, but most voters can't be bothered with navigating the complexities with such a system.\n\nLooking at the big picture, perhaps what we need is to better educate the populace on governance as a whole so that more people understand the nuances of policy deliberation. It would benefit the populace to learn about the immense amount of hard work that goes into policy making, to consider how policies affect the whole nation and not just themselves (by increasing empathy), to learn about the pros and cons of different voting systems, to be aware of the damage of disinformation and be critical of information in general, to figure out the limits of government action, and to learn effective ways anyone can make a difference outside of the government either at an individual level, or through collective effort.

Or social one for that matter. We need to remember the many Operations conducted by LKY and the PAP after they kicked out the left leaning side of the ORIGINAL PAP that got them into power in the first place. We need to remember Barisan Sosialis, and Operation Coldstore and Operation Spectrum and all the other hard (and soft) power tactics used to dismantle left leaning political opinion in Singapore.\n\nThe fact that the incumbent have made it TERRIFYING to oppose them, with the threat of Internal Security Act (where they can just anyhow detain if they feel like it, fuck the courts) or use POFMA or any of the other tools they've put in place with their overwhelming majority, is something that looms over us citizens.\n\nDo YOU want to be the next Amos Yee? They ask. Do YOU want to be Jolovan Wham, life made infinitely more difficult for a smiley face, etc? Family threatened? Social pariah?\n\nNo. So you shut the fuck up and you don't oppose so you can live your life - until the government says you can safely oppose by voting.\n\nNow imagine how much pressure that puts on you as a MEMBER OF THE OPPOSITION. You threatening the ultimate power of the highly partisan incumbent gov and every single method and trick and tactic built into the foundations of modern Singapore government.\n\nThe PAP won't let you crumble their castle down when they hold that power already. So they gerrymander. They look for chinks in the armour and sue and accuse opposition. They CHARGE you to run - tens of thousands of dollars. \n\nSo opposition parties are WOEFULLY understaffed and underfunded because they have to burn all their cash on paying for the POSSIBILITY of winning some votes and ultimately still losing to the PAP.\n\nI vote opposition because I know how horribly unfair the entire system is. How Singaporeans are a metric and statistic to the incumbent (which will ultimately kick them in the ass and they will conveniently blame on oppo/leftists). How we desperately need SOME checks and balances and leftist voices in the overwhelmingly capitalist/right-leaning \"centrist\" government.\n\nBecause PAP is not left leaning. They ran under the guise of socialism for all, and they immediately gutted the unions and workers groups that got them there. They made it so WE the people cannot organise in the same way THEY did, and demand for better. You only need NTUC right? Hong Lim Park enough?\n\nThey overturned the Brits and sat in that vacuum of power and built the castle around it and paid themselves highly to \"prevent corruption\". They have had 60 years to drill this into citizens' minds, and built their ivory towers and maintain a firm hold on what being an 'elite' means in SG by buddying up with capitalism.\n\nAsk yourself why they are afraid of leftists and artists and workers unions demanding for rights and fair pay, even if they're poor and have no social capital in current SG compared to them? Because they have always been afraid that the people will overturn them, and the opposition can at least start the process of drilling some holes in their fortifications, instead of giving them the \"mandate\" to keep building on our backs (and taxes).\n\nWe Singaporeans were born with the wool over our eyes and we are terrified to take it off because then the all-powerful Shepherd will be staring right back at you, and you alone.\n\nEdited for spelling",

Or it might be because those in charge just have one way of thinking. Or it might be because they are just as scared of change as many of us. Or maybe there are other reasons they can't say. \n\nTo me, a stronger opposition gives another avenue to get feedback to the top. They can raise issues in parliament instead of the guys on the front line having to submit feedback forms. And, if there really is a change of government, because the new government is not part of the system, I hope they will honestly confront the issues and be open to the more radical changes we need to prosper in the future. WP seems much closer to the ground than PAP, and they're already raising issues in parliament. I don't know for sure that they would be better, but I think there's a good chance they would be. \n\nI do know that doing the same old thing while the world changes around us is the most dangerous thing, and that's why I support WP. \n\nI also think we can tahan for a couple more election cycles, so if some clown fiesta opposition came to my ward I would have no problem voting PAP.",

With the PAP even though we are on a descend we arent exactly crashing into the ground but still for everyone on the plane descending means sooner or later we are going to crash or at least it feels like it. And I think because of so much cost of living and job problems people are feeling like the plane is descending a lot quicker hence people are feeling like the pilots arent trying hard enough. \n\nAnd  the increase in opposition support is simply because people are feeling that the pilots arent competent at saving this plane may as well try someone else. Whats the worse that could happen? The plane crashes? So what? it was bound to happen anyways.\n\nAnd to make the example a little more relavent the people on the plane are the younger generation and the less well-off who are facing the larger brunt of the Col and job crises. The well-off and older generations are like people who arent on the plane and just commenting. \n\nSo in my case, i understand that no matter what, this election PAP is still going to be the majority however irregardless of who it is, i will still be voting the opposition. \n\nThe value of my vote, at least for this election, is not in deciding who gets a seat in parliament because regardless of who gets in I strongly believe that it will still be a PAP majority where all policy making will still be in PAP's control i.e still having the stability with the decline. \nMy value comes in to show that I or We for people alike are not happy with them and that they need to try harder its like putting in a co-pilot that would slap them when they are falling asleep at the wheel. It also serves as a reminder that people are more and more willing to simply replace the pilot even if we arent sure what the next pilot will do because it simply couldnt get any worse.",

        "text": "on the subject of housing, this is one clear area of failing of the \u201cold guard\u201d policies. \n\nsingapore is land scarce. as more people need more homes, we build denser - smaller and higher - but at some point, density will become unsustainable. there is an upper limit to how much supply there can be.\n\nthis alone wouldn\u2019t be a problem, but it is compounded by other factors. \n\none is increasing demand, which is driven by population growth/net migration. this was a sore point back in 2013 (the 6.9m population white paper fiasco). despite the criticism and popular rejection, singapore is probably at close to a 6m resident population today. there are many reasons for this, notably people living longer (and needing housing for longer) and an aging population (which requires more caregivers over time to share the economic and social load).\n\nanother is our tax system and what it incentivises. singapore is a great place to be rich. we don\u2019t tax capital gains for example, so when you sell your house for a profit, that profit goes directly into your pocket with minimal deductions. tight supply plus no capital gains tax makes investing in property a no-brainer, IF you can afford to. and if you can afford it, even the additional stamp duty is not going to disincentivise you by much. \n\nthen there is mission creep with public housing. instead of focusing on affordable public housing, we flirted with aspirational housing - exec condos, maisonettes, pinnacle at duxton, dawson sky terrace. the sale prices for these were considerably higher, and a lucky ballot in those developments would be a small fortune when reselling. but if \u201cpublic\u201d housing costs that much, then private developments must cost more. that and our \u201cpro-business\u201d environment means that there\u2019s enough foreign demand to soak up what can\u2019t be sold to domestic buyers. \n\nwhat can be done about these problems? nothing that does not come with a lot of pain, unfortunately. once you\u2019re stuck in the trap, there are no easy ways out. \n\nwe could lower land sale prices. this means less money in government coffers from the \u201csale\u201d of land. this, along with curbs on loans (e.g. raising the TDSR percentage) will force property prices down. this will hurt ALL homeowners. those with more (more properties, more debt) will hurt more. but future generations - our children and grandchildren - will benefit from our sacrifice. \n\nanother extreme policy would be to end freehold land sales and for the government to reacquire existing plots. it\u2019s an open secret that some property developers sell leasehold homes while actually owning the freehold land it sits on. this allows the developer (probably the descendants of the developer) to redevelop and sell homes again and again every two or three generations - and infinite money printing machine! one can make the argument that land being as scarce as it is in singapore, only the government of the day should have the privilege of running this scheme.\n\nas you point out, there are no solutions that don\u2019t involve hurting someone or even everyone. but if the measures are well reasoned, explained well and regularly, and sufficient warning is given ahead of housing reforms, we may yet arrive at a more equitable, efficient and effective housing system.",

I'm not entirely sure if this was awkwardly phrased and that you meant to ask how the opposition is going to solve these issues rather than how we think they are going to solve them. So, I'll try to address both in short order.\n\nHow the voters' think the opposition will address them: again, you seem to he holding the PAP to different standards. The PAP has already shown definitively to voters that they can't solve these issues having been the government presiding over the development of these problems. The opposition has not shown whether or not they can solve these problems.\n\nHow the opposition proposes to solve these issues: read their manifestos and listen to their speeches. Seems weird for you to ask us to do your homework for you. Further, ask the PAP how they are going to solve these issues; they can't and they won't because deep-down they know these are features of their policies and not issues to be solved.",

At the end of the day it will still be the PAP proposing the laws and making policy because they\u2019re going to be the ones forming government again. But if there was more opposition in Parliament there will be more scrutiny of what the PAP is proposing, more pointed questions, more putting these plans to the test and drumming up public discourse on these matters. The PAP will have to work harder to justify why it wants to do things the way it does, and if they feel less confident that Singaporeans will support them no matter what they will be forced to take ground sentiment into consideration more.",

Regardless if the people in parliament are PAP or WP, both parties should and must work together to make life better for Singaporeans and not engage in petty political play.

        "text": "For those people who keep harping on other countries\u2019 politics, I think we should always remember we live in one of the richest countries in the world, yet too many of our people are struggling and why? I\u2019m not even talking about just the lower income, but the middle income, the sandwich generation. It has been a pattern for years that the ruling party has remained elitist, and on their high horse and I think that\u2019s a big reason people are pissed. \n\nHow out of touch are they from reality when they can make comments such as \u201cyou only need a small space to have sex\u201d and don\u2019t even bother getting me started on the Income-Allianz saga, Ridout saga. All these point to one thing which is that the ruling party is faltering and there are too many in the incumbent that are incapable, arrogant and sneaky. \n\nThe fact they can throw back questions that opposition MPs and NCMPs raise in parliament with that snark that is so damn obvious that shows what\u2019s going in their heads which is \u201cwho are you to question me or my actions\u201d (cue Indranee, CCS, Vivian\u2019s lousy school comment and many more sleeping in parliament). Worst is when the questions are valid and they refuse to answer it directly citing national security interests and whatnot which ends up making opp MPs look like a fool. Doesn\u2019t help that the media hypes it up and turns them into memes.\n\nI have never agreed on one of their really bad habits of parachuting generals into the Cabinet and keeping the parliament full of their own, selected elite members.  Notwithstanding the fact that they always take care of and protect their own members even when there is clear fault, the job security they have is insane compared to normal working Singaporeans. Voted out? That\u2019s okay there\u2019s always NTUC. In short, they control everything and there\u2019s no one to tell them no. Hell, even when they pulled back on the Income sale, they had to pass a new law/bill to fix mistakes that THEY made. Even if they make mistakes, there\u2019s no accountability, and people are fed up.\n\nThe WP, PSP members have proven how hard they fought to get their, and our voices into parliament just to ensure checks and balances. If WP didn\u2019t voice out on the Income-Allianz saga, it would\u2019ve for sure been buried and the sale would\u2019ve went on. People are not stupid anymore and they want to vote for someone deserving that can hear them instead of those who can never relate.\n\nIt\u2019s 2025, our opposition parties have come a long way. They have decent manifestos (most of them) and new talents that are comparable to PAP candidates. Any of them could\u2019ve worked their way into PAP but they chose not to. Many people only know and see what the media shows them, but if we do just a little bit of research we can see that the opposition does have capable members that have sound ideas, and some that even PAP revamps as their own. I\u2019ve read up on some of their manifestos and seen their proposals and they aren\u2019t just \u2018all talk no action\u2019. You can\u2019t expect them to act when they have limited resources. The smear campaigns and gutter politics don\u2019t help either. In fact, the PAP\u2019s manifesto was so lacking it was appalling for the ruling party. \n\nCase in point, GE2025 has been nothing but petty jabs at each other, from both the ruling party and opposition. None of them has thrown out anything concrete which is indeed frustrating. Doesn\u2019t help either that certain SMCs and GRCs have been gerrymandered away and certain MPS have been parachuted into diff constituencies last minute. \n\nEven if we are just voting the opposition to keep PAP in check, PAP will be the government and the ruling party for many more years to come. Having more voices and voting for the opposition is to ensure that these seats in parliament are not fully occupied by just them alone and they don\u2019t just pass laws as and how they like. We need capable opposition like WP and PSP to come in to question their decisions because we can\u2019t do so ourselves. We need the opposition because the incumbent are trying to hop on a bullet train to 10 million citizens when Singaporeans who are born and bred here are falling behind. Just because it doesn\u2019t happen around you doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not happening to others. That\u2019s why I will be voting for the opposition. \n\nAs for why people vote for the opposition despite the fact that they belong to a constituency with terrible ones, in my opinion it is to give some opposition parties confidence to dedicate their resources in certain constituencies based on the outcome of the votes. Many want to entice the good opposition to come and contest their constituency. I think many Singaporeans see PAP as the default vote because they feel they do not have an option when the other party contesting in their area is lacking.",

        "text": "Because people either\n\n\\- blame pap for reality falling short of the perfect ideal they have (eg even though many complainers still buy their iPhones and eat haidilao and go on nice holidays every year with whole family, they still blame pap for every pinch they feel when they pay for things that are more expensive than they think it should be. Eg, I know a couple who is rich enough to stay in a beautiful condo in East coast, have had family trips a few times a year, sometimes even sit business class, both kids wear nice clothes, eat good food, eat at nice restaurants weekly, but they are unhappy with Pap for high living cost, they say middle class people like them are \"suffering\" lol).\n\n\\- still harbour residual subconscious mindset that every western ideology is the superior way. Democracy is a manmade concept. It's not some holy grail truth. Yet, people say that our system is not \"democratic\" enough. We do have a democracy, but why do we have to have 2 equally strong parties? Look at Usa where people are so divided. Where both parties care more about party survival than national interests. Then look at \"communist\" China. Which country is better run, better managed? The country with the \"dictator\" or the ever changing carousel of lousy presidents and good ideas like Obamacare gets instantly dismantled by the next Prez and not allowed to evolve and strengthen?\n\n\\- fall into herd mentality trap where when life becomes a bit harder because of inflation from wars, crazy Usa, trade wars, etc they wanna blame the most visible party ie Pap. They are always just pointing out the mistakes Pap does. They point out if a Pap minister nods off during parliament but says nothing about the stupid and dangerously destructive things that Wp tries to float during parliament eg Jamus wanna reveal size of national reserves to public, which would be economic suicide.\n\nSo far, I have been very unimpressed with the opposition. Pritam seems quite dishonest to me, Jamus kinda stupid and seems to get policy ideas from Usa, Sylvia does not seem to have any outstanding trait other than being unlikable in her actions and speech, etc.",

Can PAP do more to make things better? Definitely. Can a new party do it? A question mark. Will they do it? Another question mark.\n\nSo your argument is that because the opposition have never been in the position to govern, we should not consider putting them in the position to govern? Why even have a democracy at all then, if the only first party to govern should always be the one to govern by virtue of being the only party to have any experience governing?\n\nIf you had said that the opposition is less qualified any number of reasons that are not a function of not being part of the sole ruling party since independence, your argument might have more merit. \n\nFear of uncertainty is exactly what the PAP banks on though. And to their credit, because few countries in history have ever been run as smoothly and as well as Singapore has over the last 50 years, to many people that means any potential positive change from the status quo would be marginal at best (because the bar is already so high), and any potential negative change is to big a risk (because even if the probability is small, we have a long way to fall). And so, I'm pretty sure the PAP will continue to win by a landslide.",
