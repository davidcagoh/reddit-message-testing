(please do not trot out the argument that the government needs to be \"strong\" to execute policies - democracy necessarily requires that *what* policies ought to be pursued be settled first. we have the third reich and gaddafi's libya as haunting reminders of what might happen if \"strong\" is prioritised over democracy.)\n\ni have no illusions that the wp will be \"so much better\" than the pap, should the wp come to be the dominant party in singapore. ultimately, human nature is difficult to change. power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. to guard against this, and to mitigate the risks, it is important to have two political parties counterbalancing and offsetting each other.\n\nof late, i have seen the incumbent pap sliding more towards an autocratic state, where they generally do not really care what the population they govern thinks. nobody asked for pofma, nobody asked for two successive gst hikes, nobody asked ntuc income to be sold, nobody asked for the reserved presidency, nobody asked for the redrawing electoral boundaries and the disappearing of certain smcs. in my view, it is therefore an appropriate juncture for me to vote for the wp, to bring another political party more strongly into parliament, so as to ensure that the pap redirects its efforts to serve the country.\n\nthis is particularly the case when you witness the 'talent' that the pap has been bringing (or attempting to bring) into its fold in recent years: tan see leng, poh li san, gho sze kee, ivan lim, marshall lim, alvin tan, lee hui ying etc. these people are far from the calibre that the country needs to run the country. in contrast, the wp has been fielding candidates that are increasingly credible (harpreet singh, for example, received his senior counsel accolade well before edwin tong). the time may be now to give them a chance.",

    "text": "here's my attempt to answer your questions, even though these points have already been brought up time and time again by the wp and other opposition parties. i apologise for the long post. \n\n1. an opposition functions as a check and balance on the ruling party. without elected opposition mps in parliament, how exactly do you expect the ruling party to be kept in check? does the pap need 97/97 seats to function? no. but having a sizeable opposition presence allows for constructive debates in parliament on alternative policy ideas as well as the drawbacks and tradeoffs of policies that pap seeks to implement, so that the public is kept informed. and the wp has been functioning as that check and balance for years now and 4 out of the top 5 mps that filed the most pqs and participated the most in parliamentary debates were from the wp. \n\n2. constitutional amendments can only be passed with a 2/3 majority in parliament. all other decisions can be passed with a simple majority. why? because the constitution is the highest law of the land. the fact that the pap can, and has, amended the constitution so many times despite public disapproval should be a cause of concern. the most controversial amendment passed in recent memory is the amendment of the constitution to reserve the presidency for a minority candidate. even minorities were opposed to this, as it reeks of tokenism. minorities want to be elected on merits too. and the amendments only effectively prevented the then very popular tcb from contesting the elections. another controversial amendment is the introduction of the ncmp scheme, where non-elected losing candidates have rights to vote on important legislation. how is this democratic? which is why, for years, opposition parties have been asking for singaporeans to deny the pap a 2/3 majority. in every other democratic society, having more than 60 out of 97 seats in parliament would be considered a great victory. \n\n3. a large opposition party with resources and members that has the ability to form a shadow cabinet cannot form out of thin air. it has to develop over time. and the closest we have to a credible, alternative party other than the pap is the wp because it has won the most seats of any opposition party. the wp is volunteer driven at its core. it does not have a large policy team. and yet, time and time again, they have come up with alternative policy ideas and pathways to implementation. they are not throwing shit at the pap or at our civil service and criticising for the sake of criticising. they know singaporeans expect practical, feasible policies and that is exactly what they have been trying to come up with. some may be good, some may be bad but in a democracy, you debate and you compromise and eventually, you reach a landing that works for all stakeholders. not have one party dominate all discussions.\n\n4. the ones doing the actual work is not the pap. it is our civil service, which is supposed to be apolitical. but because they work for the government of the day and the pap has been the government all these years, the civil service is often seen as intertwined with the pap. but the civil service is made up of exemplary, hardworking individuals and is the biggest resource at the disposal of the pap. they are the ones coming up with policy ideas and they are the ones working behind the scenes and consulting stakeholders to find out what works, what are the trade-offs etc. these are the people who deserve the credit, not the pap. but that doesn't mean the civil service doesn't have blind spots because they are simply following their boss's instructions. they work on a particular ideology. the role of an opposition is to help identify these blindspots that may be missed because of group think. \n\n5. ironically, the party that continually harps on us being in a crisis is the pap. they tell us singapore is entering turbulent waters and they need a strong mandate to govern. the opposition tells you that singapore will be better off with them checking on the pap even as we enter these turbulent waters. it is up to you to decide which you agree with. and while you may be privileged enough to not feel it, there are groups of people in singapore that are impacted by high cost of living (it is a crisis for them) and housing affordability (it is a crisis for singles). \n\nin short, the answer to your question is, if you don't try, you will never know. the wp is the only opposition party that has successfully run town councils over multiple terms and is the only party that has proved its worth in parliament. it is singapore's best chance at allowing a credible alternative to develop. them losing seats will be a setback for democracy in singapore, in my opinion. but i do respect the alternative view which is that pap has a good system of internal checks and balance, has offered singaporeans stability for years and may operate best when it has an extremely strong mandate.",

(so now what happens if it affects you. are you going to swing to the incumbent? i'm going to expect alot of elephants in the room already once wp's policies do not benefit you)\n\nthis is irony at its finest and the same feminism crap debate that is still going on - people only want to cherry pick their wins and refuse to accept any drawbacks. and this is the true elephant in the room, in which people refuse to admit they only want policies for their selfish gain and will gladly swing themselves to other side once they aren't a beneficiary of a system.\n\n  \nso what you are missing here is because the surface level arguments are too muddied and circular in nature - dig past the surface and you will see only self-interest wrapped in abstract justifications.\n\nhowever, i'd like to highlight that this is not representative of the other branch of folks that need to lean left (for political, economic, social, cultural, reasons) - there is a deeply rooted justification and i'm all for it.\n\n  \nso with that out of the way, lets get back to the question on \"what exactly are you voting opposition for?\"\n\nin a system that benefits a class of individuals and that one is not a true beneficiary of - obviously one would like to push for left wing ideologies in a deeply rooted right leaning dominant system - think of the slightly less skilled folks who are 1 layoff away from financial trouble or because the floodgates were open for external employment in which wages are depressed. or perhaps those individuals that want a more open left ideology related to gender fluidity, acceptng other woke cultural norms, etc. or even specific sagas that left bright folks thrown under the bus (the bio sector push in the early 2010s, but the govt bailed out eventually - so think of the straight a student entering uni with a bioengg degree under the govt's empty promises and essentially received early carerr suicide. we can go on here but you get the gist.\n\nso its my opinion here - but we should all look into the ideologies behind a polititcal system (left vs right) and then stand by it in a principled way. its really not so much on the circular reasoning, the checks and balances or deny the super majority, or the selfish mindset of \"whats in it for me\". \n\n(altho i do know that this wont happen. thats why we always call society a sinkie pwn sinkie mentality.)",

    "text": "why i would vote opposition this ge.\n\n1) to prevent pap from becoming an echo chamber and promote diversity of opinion. specifically, i am uncomfortable with so many civil servants being parachuted into various high level roles without (in my opinion) relevant credentials and experience. \n\ncase in point, ntuc income saga - this was such a typical m&a / pe strategy, that anybody who had some experience in investment banking could smell this miles away. it really makes me question the leaders competence since they said it was in \"good faith\" as well as whether the overall plan of air-dropping ex-generals into various high ranking places makes sense. \n\n2) i personally feel that some pap candidates are less hungry to improve the system, instead are just satisfied with maintaining the status quo. this in the long-run will result in organizational inefficiency and stagnation, which i actually do see within certain civil service branches. any system that does not evolve will be left behind, as we have seen with many of the old-gen \"famous\" local companies (e.g. hin leong's lack of proper risk management)\n\non the other hand, wp candidates overall seem competent and eager to prove their worth and willing to question existing status quo for improvement. i believe that this is good for any well functioning organization. sadly, i find it hard to say the same for most other opposition parties. \n\non specifically housing affordability, \n\nwp's manifesto kind of addresses it in a mild-way with the overarching message that houses are meant for singaporeans to stay in, instead of being seen as a safe haven investment. i agree with the message but not the implementation steps, which i feel could be more forceful (probably to err on side of caution with voters). \n\ntried and tested ways of making investment properties less attractive could include taxing rental income / capital gains on non-owner occupied properties, increasing property tax for non-owner occupied properties significantly or even like a hefty estate tax on non-owner occupied properties.",
