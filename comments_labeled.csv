"I served as a grassroots leader for the last 5 years, and one of the rare ones who are not in the political party, even when they did ask. 

I too am on the fence, as over the years of serving as a grassroots leader (GRL) shows you the inner workings of how the constituency works (am also in CCC). I feel at times it’s just pandering to the MPs whims and fancies, doing stuff to give high visibility but not much real impact. For example, continually giving “welfare packs” to a rental block when clearly that rental block is over-welfared with multiple organisations doing the exact same thing, just because it’s easy and has great photo moments. 

I did raise up during meetings, and got branded as a troublemaker. 

And in the 5 years, I realise that the ruling party is mostly (though not all, but in this case, mine) about visibility rather than impact, about great photos rather than actual helping people who need help. 

I would VTO in a heartbeat - but the only crappy part is the opposition in my area is really disorganised and I’m unconvinced that they can’t represent us, add value to my life, or even speak up for policies.

"As a former servant, I had to work under their hypocrisy for about a decade. I still work for an agency and am currently suffering under one unpopular minister whom I hope will be booted out. 


You know what ministers and MPs do? Everything is calculated to garner your votes. That includes covering up public fund wastage and not daring to report to you when certain public schemes have not achieved intended outcomes. They also waste public servants' time by parachuting in absolutely trashy permanent secretaries (few exceptions) and superscale officers who do nothing to improve the working lives of servants - people whom they have a direct impact on. You want me to trust them with governance of the country? They don't know the meaning of humanity if it slapped them in the face. 


If ministers truly cared about people and not votes, they would first look out for those who have to suffer implementing their last minute decrees with no proper resource planning and almost zero respect for governance. You are the ones who put up the red tape but you force us to skirt the red tape so voters like you more when you push initiatives out faster. When we get in trouble for it, where are you? Did you own up and say oh we skipped some steps cos I asked for it? Some minister even had the cheek to poke fun at the red tape we struggle to enforce. In public. Who cares about public servants' efforts to safeguard public funds? As long as this clown is standing in my GRC I will rather die than vote for him. 


I saw some 'popular' ministers who people think are very up there cos they seem to do a lot. Ask the people who work for them if you want the truth. Those are the people who have to near kill themselves and jump through hoops to do whatever the bigshot wants so that he can stay in power. At the expense of our families and physical and mental well being. 


I work for the public and the community and I separate it from whoever the minister is because I truly see nothing that they have contributed, only how they make my life difficult. I do see their blatant disregard for my colleagues' well-being, their disrespect of governance principles, policies and procedures, all to milk your favour. 


I don't see why anyone should vote to reward achievements of the past either. Just look at how HDB floor plans have evolved through the years. From a design that made sense to a design where I can only conclude that the government hates us. I don't even hate on the size - you can design it with privacy in mind so that I don't have to think about strangers being able to look in. I am not even talking about the price though I know it is really stressing everyone out. I bought my house under pressure without having the time to consider if it was OK because with every transaction, prices went up by 20k. Now I have to suffer with my crappy floorplan and 500k regret.


Lastly, PAP candidates were kind of rude and like 'who are u to tell me off for not following the rules'. I didn't even have to tell WP off cos they followed the rules. That's your typical PAP entitled behaviour that I'm used to. 


I cannot list the laundry list of things I know about the PAP that makes me hate them cos obviously OSA. But it is so bad that the only emotion I have when it comes to PAP is disgust, anger, hatred, and loathing. The perfect word is a malay word - menyampah.

"My thoughts. Not to start drama. 

I think the biggest issue for many people is how their ""own"" people will always be taken care of. And always it is by the tax payers or GLC/TLC linked companies. 

For example, NCM lost the election but somehow NTUC can come out and say that no need elected also can continue to be NTUC secgen. The 'ambrage' general can go and f up every corporation he goes to and still be posted to other cushy jobs. The multiple NTUC director postings and the list goes on. 

The entire machinery is fixed to support them where the person who lost the election can be appointed Grassroots advisor, WTF are they advising? PA allows usage of spaces and buildings paid for by taxpayers solely for PAP related events. Even opposition elected MPs have no right to use them. 

The fact that CCS can ask Pritam , "" why you want to know?"", despite the fact that he is faking elected. Basically questioning his intent and not so clearly saying he wanted to cause harm. 

The fact the LMW when he ask for a breakdown of stats can be scolded and put down in parliament.

It is the unfairness that the current blatantly displays that is causing so much ill feelings. 

If the average Singaporean is supposed to compete with the global talent then why these handpicked 皇亲国戚 can be protected to this magnitude? And funded mostly with tax payers monies. 

When the economy is good then it is because of brilliant leadership and governance, when things are not good then it is a global trend which they have no control over.

When they screw up then it is ""let's move on"" and when anyone else make a mistake then it is""please explain"".

Competition in workforce:
Alot of the foreigners that are brought here are just to make us more competitive.

"I feel like questions like this are very misleading. Not intentionally (I presume), but because of the way many Singaporeans have been conditioned.

First of all, it assumes that voting for the PAP is the default. And you need a ""reason"" to vote for the opposition. There is no default state. Every party and candidate must earn my vote. 

Now that is clear, voting for the opposition, to me, offers a better vision than the PAP. Right now, I believe that is true. For the simple reason that having 90% of seats in parliament is completely against my interests. This has proven true on several occasions, with blatant disregard for the constitution.

Second, what does having 90% PAP MPs provide that 60% doesn't? Nothing. PAP forms the govt and passes all the legislation it needs to.

So it is very clear to me, unless I buy into the notion that the PAP can lose its majority, that voting for the opposition is in my interest (as long as I view them as credible). And I don't buy into the PAPs fear mongering of losing their majority.

So the PAP could hypothetically have had the most perfect and well governed 5 years (which it didn't, for the record) , and I still wouldn't give them 90% of Parliament.",71,4/26/25 14:31,misteraaaaa,1,0,1,0,0,0

"I believe that PAP does a good job and is underappreciated in many ways. Their strong suit is managing. They go for the obvious choices and solutions and move slowly on things. Call that being cautious. However, I noticed that PAP had very severe internal rot going on. They are good keeping the machine going but lack real creativity and/or direction. When speed is needed they are not agile enough to act on it and capitalise on opportunities. 

For example, regarding tax issues, they often see tax as the only way to be sustainable. However, everyone knows that our wealth fund makes quite a bit of money. In fact, half of the yearly budget comes from investment returns. Those who remember their economics will know that tax creates social costs and deadweight loss. Im sorry for those who didn't get to study this module. 

Tax is a way to balance the scale between the rich and poor We get that. But sometimes enough is enough. Im sure the government has the resources to think of ways to generate revenue. When the opposition proposes something, the first reaction for the PAP is to fix the opposition and not address the issue. It makes me very sick listening to the stupid things ministers say in parliament and on other occasions. It demonstrates that these MPs are out of touch with the ground and/or are just too full of themselves.

I believe our true wealth lies with our next generation, but government is so focused on numbers (GDP) that they rather drive singaporeans to death with long working hours than to legislate a fairer working hours for all so that we can have more time for family and kids. They are missing the forest for the trees. Yes, population issue is faced by most developed countries but we paid top dollar for ministers to solve issues and problems. We need some entrepreneurship and mental finesse here.

Opposition's role is to create rigorous intellectual competition with the incumbent, so that we as a nation can and will grow. If you want to be good, you need a friend, but if you want to be great, you definitely need an enemy. Yes many complained about weak oppositions, that is another topic - the PAP uses several methods to ensure that if you are opposition you are going to face a lot of difficulties, therefore resulting in a very small pool of talented people who want to be an opposition MP.",11,4/26/25 19:21,Embarrassed-Counter6,0,0,1,0,0,0
"A single-party dominated polity is a dangerous one. This is because if there is a tilt towards autocracy or a dictatorship, there will be no bipartisan institutions and mechanisms in place to check the slide.

A two-party polity will mean that each side will always be supervised and watched, and this oversight will ensure that both parties will always be on their best behaviour and also doing their best. Mutual oversight and mutual competition will mean that ultimately, Singaporeans will benefit. (Please do not trot out the argument that the Government needs to be ""strong"" to execute policies - democracy necessarily requires that *what* policies ought to be pursued be settled first. We have the Third Reich and Gaddafi's Libya as haunting reminders of what might happen if ""strong"" is prioritised over democracy.)

I have no illusions that the WP will be ""so much better"" than the PAP, should the WP come to be the dominant party in Singapore. Ultimately, human nature is difficult to change. Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. To guard against this, and to mitigate the risks, it is important to have two political parties counterbalancing and offsetting each other.

Of late, I have seen the incumbent PAP sliding more towards an autocratic state, where they generally do not really care what the population they govern thinks. Nobody asked for POFMA, nobody asked for two successive GST hikes, nobody asked NTUC Income to be sold, nobody asked for the reserved Presidency, nobody asked for the redrawing electoral boundaries and the disappearing of certain SMCs. In my view, it is therefore an appropriate juncture for me to vote for the WP, to bring another political party more strongly into Parliament, so as to ensure that the PAP redirects its efforts to serve the country.

This is particularly the case when you witness the 'talent' that the PAP has been bringing (or attempting to bring) into its fold in recent years: Tan See Leng, Poh Li San, Gho Sze Kee, Ivan Lim, Marshall Lim, Alvin Tan, Lee Hui Ying etc. These people are far from the calibre that the country needs to run the country.

This is a valid opinion imo. The whole point of being an elected leader is that people like you and want you there. A capable manager who is an asshole is still gonna have people wanting them out. 

To turn around and tell those people that they are wrong or misguided for wanting the guy out simply because the next guy may not be much better, dismisses their current feelings.

In addition, you could say the same thing for some PAP supporters. They vote that way because they hate anyone who goes against their chosen party. Yet somehow we treat PAP supporters as morally or intellectually superior because of their choice?

1. An opposition functions as a check and balance on the ruling party. Without elected opposition MPs in Parliament, how exactly do you expect the ruling party to be kept in check? Does the PAP need 97/97 seats to function? No. But having a sizeable opposition presence allows for constructive debates in Parliament on alternative policy ideas as well as the drawbacks and tradeoffs of policies that PAP seeks to implement, so that the public is kept informed. And the WP has been functioning as that check and balance for years now and 4 out of the top 5 MPs that filed the most PQs and participated the most in Parliamentary debates were from the WP. 

2. Constitutional amendments can only be passed with a 2/3 majority in Parliament. All other decisions can be passed with a simple majority. Why? Because the constitution is the highest law of the land. The fact that the PAP can, and has, amended the Constitution so many times despite public disapproval should be a cause of concern. The most controversial amendment passed in recent memory is the amendment of the Constitution to reserve the Presidency for a minority candidate. Even minorities were opposed to this, as it reeks of tokenism. Minorities want to be elected on merits too. And the amendments only effectively prevented the then very popular TCB from contesting the elections. Another controversial amendment is the introduction of the NCMP scheme, where non-elected losing candidates have rights to vote on important legislation. How is this democratic? Which is why, for years, opposition parties have been asking for Singaporeans to deny the PAP a 2/3 majority. In every other democratic society, having more than 60 out of 97 seats in Parliament would be considered a great victory. 

3. A large opposition party with resources and members that has the ability to form a shadow Cabinet cannot form out of thin air. It has to develop over time. And the closest we have to a credible, alternative party other than the PAP is the WP because it has won the most seats of any opposition party. The WP is volunteer driven at its core. It does not have a large policy team. And yet, time and time again, they have come up with alternative policy ideas and pathways to implementation. They are not throwing shit at the PAP or at our civil service and criticising for the sake of criticising. They know Singaporeans expect practical, feasible policies and that is exactly what they have been trying to come up with. Some may be good, some may be bad but in a democracy, you debate and you compromise and eventually, you reach a landing that works for all stakeholders. Not have one party dominate all discussions.

4. The ones doing the actual work is not the PAP. It is our civil service, which is supposed to be apolitical. But because they work for the Government of the day and the PAP has been the Government all these years, the civil service is often seen as intertwined with the PAP. But the civil service is made up of exemplary, hardworking individuals and is the biggest resource at the disposal of the PAP. They are the ones coming up with policy ideas and they are the ones working behind the scenes and consulting stakeholders to find out what works, what are the trade-offs etc. These are the people who deserve the credit, not the PAP. But that doesn't mean the civil service doesn't have blind spots because they are simply following their boss's instructions. They work on a particular ideology. The role of an opposition is to help identify these blindspots that may be missed because of group think. 

5. Ironically, the party that continually harps on us being in a crisis is the PAP. They tell us Singapore is entering turbulent waters and they need a strong mandate to govern. The opposition tells you that Singapore will be better off with them checking on the PAP even as we enter these turbulent waters. It is up to you to decide which you agree with. And while you may be privileged enough to not feel it, there are groups of people in Singapore that are impacted by high cost of living (it is a crisis for them) and housing affordability (it is a crisis for singles). 

In short, the answer to your question is, if you don't try, you will never know. The WP is the only opposition party that has successfully run town councils over multiple terms and is the only party that has proved its worth in Parliament. It is Singapore's best chance at allowing a credible alternative to develop. Them losing seats will be a setback for democracy in Singapore, in my opinion. But I do respect the alternative view which is that PAP has a good system of internal checks and balance, has offered Singaporeans stability for years and may operate best when it has an extremely strong mandate.",10,4/26/25 14:52,Substantial_Tell_117,1,0,0,1,0,0
"From an ethical/moral standpoint, I can’t bring myself to support the PAP. Lee Kuan Yew had a history of imprisoning his political rivals without a trial, where they were treated extremely inhumanly, and later on, when that wasn’t as easy anymore, dragging them into the court to bankrupt them. He went on to remove the Law Society’s ability to stop the courts from being abused, etc. The current generation of PAP leaders have shown that they’re perfectly willing to create laws to do similar things, such as POFMA. There may be no equivalent to ISD today, but there doesn’t need to be. Just make a law, and then fuck people over with it if they dare dissent. 

All the checks and balances that existed in the past to prevent the PAP from abusing their power have been removed. The *only* thing left is voting, and they gerrymander the shit out of it every god damn election. The media is controlled by the state. The PAP withheld quality of life upgrades that should have been given out to every citizen, which is basically blackmail. They may not be doing it now, but there hasn’t been much effort to dispel that notion. The pervasive belief that your job in the civil service is dependent on you voting the PAP continues to live on. I wish they would just come out and say it explicitly, that your civil service job would not be affected at all by voting opposition, but I suppose it benefits the incumbent to let that belief stay.

The fact that they’ve built this cult of personality around LKY is just the shitty icing on the cake really. The whole narrative around the sleepy fishing village, third world to first blah blah blah, all so that they can whore out his memory to get people to vote for them… it’s pathetic. And kinda disgusting. It benefits them to gloss over all his wrongs because he’s basically worshipped; for all the emphasis on how LKY didn’t want his house to become a shrine, it’s funny that the people who keep parroting that are the ones who very much revere him and treat his word as law. So much for not wanting to be deified.

And so they continue hoarding power, paying themselves exorbitant salaries, implying that it’ll somehow prevent corruption, all while refusing to define a poverty line and implement minimum wages. Didn’t work for Iswaran, did it? So should we pay them even more then?

"Regardless, the PAP will remain the government in power. Even with new faces, the same senior leaders continue to hold control, and these newcomers often appear to be groomed to follow directives without substantial influence.

What’s particularly concerning is that some PAP ministers have made elitist remarks in Parliament and still continue to represent us Singaporeans. For instance, in September 2021, during a parliamentary debate on jobs and foreign worker policies, Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan was caught on a hot mic referring to Progress Singapore Party NCMP Leong Mun Wai as “illiterate” and questioning how he got into Raffles Institution, adding, “Must have been a lousy school.”  Despite public backlash and calls for accountability, Dr. Balakrishnan remained in his position, raising questions about whether such attitudes truly represent the values of everyday Singaporeans.

- pap’s speech emphasised that they’ve been with singapore every step of the way. i understand that’s really meaningful for the merdeka and pioneer generations, but as a gen z, that message didn’t really connect with me.
- they also talked about things like affordability, but didn’t actually lay out specific plans or measures. it felt a bit vague.
- on the other hand, the opposition candidates didn’t resort to personal attacks against pap, which is important to me because it shows a level of maturity and respect that’s much needed.
- more importantly, they laid out their plans clearly. their ideas and beliefs resonated with me, and i found myself agreeing with what they proposed.

initially, based on first impressions, how they presented themselves, and finding out a little bit about each candidate, i felt like i trusted the pap candidates more than the opposition. but i think this changed it for me. it’s not about blindly hating the pap or even blindly supporting the opposition. it’s about listening carefully and deciding who actually speaks to my concerns and future.

"Truth be told a lot of Redditors hate for the sake of hating. As an oppo supporter there is not a shadow of doubt in my mind that PAP is the best Government there is for Singapore — you need only look out your window and around you for the evidence.

A family friend (hardcore PAP supporter since the 70s/80s) told me recently: Don’t listen to the oppo; the PAP are the ones who built Singapore. You know what? I agree entirely with him — and that’s why I vote oppo. Because LKY, the man who built Singapore, was alive today, he would not have allowed for the 4G batch to be in the state that they are now.

Where LKY was decisive and bold, the 4G is secretive and suspicious. Where LKY decried those who treat politics as a “game of cards”, the 4G has shuffled anchor Ministers around like poker chips in the eleventh hour before nomination. And where LKY was loyal to Singaporeans, creating and guarding our financial interests, the 3G/4G seems to be loyal to KPI, GDP and _Allianz_, of all things. 

That is my honest reason for voting opposition. The PAP I believe is a rare example of a Government which is truly free of corruption and capable of leading Singapore for many decades to come. But in order to prevent them from becoming blind, arrogant, and out of touch, they must continue to feel the pinch during elections — for, more than anything else, this batch of 4G Ministers needs to be reminded that they are not above reproach, or politically immortal.",10,4/27/25 0:21,keepereagle,1,0,0,0,0,0

I’ve been watching introduction videos of opposition party candidates (WP and PSP), and all of them clearly articulated what motivated them to run for election.

That got me curious about the new MP from the incumbent party who’s seeking re-election—but I struggled to get a clear sense of who she is, what she stands for, or what drives her.

The outgoing MP encouraged residents to support her, highlighting her kindness and compassion. But really, aren’t those just basic expectations? Surely, no one campaigning for public office would admit to being mean-spirited.

The new candidate spoke about the doubts she and her family had about stepping forward, and vaguely expressed a desire to “have a bigger impact, to make a bigger difference.” Yet, it was difficult to pin down what kind of change she hopes to bring, or what truly compels her to serve.

I did come across a video of her speaking at the party’s annual gathering, where she explained that she became a branch activist because she wanted to protect Singapore from what she described as populist policies proposed by opposition parties to win votes. That finally offered a glimpse into her perspective—but it also worries me, because the PAP often tends to label any alternative ideas from the opposition as “populist,” dismissing them without genuine engagement.

Now more than ever, we need different views and fresh solutions. If someone’s main motivation is simply to defend the status quo, I find it hard to see that as a calling worth rallying behind.",3,4/26/25 16:38,hsy71,0,0,0,1,0,0

For them, they are a beneficiary of a right-leaning pro business system in which the incumbent built from ground up but now want to bite the hand that fed them - it really doesn't make much sense.

You can refer to the singapore thread:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/s/NFERc9iMky](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/s/NFERc9iMky)

Look at the comments on like - 

1. only tax landed property, but not 1M HDB flats (then now why are you reducing the avenue of taxation then?)

2. as long as I'm not the tax bracket that is affected, its fine with me. (so now what happens if it affects you. are you going to swing to the incumbent? I'm going to expect ALOT of elephants in the room already once WP's policies do not benefit you)

This is irony at its finest and the same feminism crap debate THAT is still going on - people only want to cherry pick their wins and refuse to accept any drawbacks. And this is the true elephant in the room, in which people refuse to admit they only want policies for their selfish gain and will gladly swing themselves to other side once they aren't a beneficiary of a system.

  
So what you are missing here is because the surface level arguments are too muddied and circular in nature - dig past the surface and you will see only self-interest wrapped in abstract justifications.

However, I'd like to highlight that this is not representative of the other branch of folks that need to lean left (for political, economic, social, cultural, reasons) - there is a deeply rooted justification and I'm all for it.

  
So with that out of the way, lets get back to the question on ""what exactly are you voting opposition for?""

In a system that benefits a class of individuals and that one is not a true beneficiary of - obviously one would like to push for left wing ideologies in a deeply rooted right leaning dominant system - think of the slightly less skilled folks who are 1 layoff away from financial trouble or because the floodgates were open for external employment in which wages are depressed. Or perhaps those individuals that want a more open left ideology related to gender fluidity, acceptng other woke cultural norms, etc. Or even specific sagas that left bright folks thrown under the bus (the bio sector push in the early 2010s, but the govt bailed out eventually - so think of the straight A student entering uni with a bioengg degree under the govt's empty promises and essentially received early carerr suicide. we can go on here but you get the gist.

so its my opinion here - but we should all look into the ideologies behind a polititcal system (left vs right) and then stand by it in a principled way. Its really not so much on the circular reasoning, the checks and balances or deny the super majority, or the selfish mindset of ""whats in it for me"".

"My take is slightly different. Coming from a conviction/passion POV, what many ppl fail to realise is that the (respectable) oppo are fighting even when they don’t need to - and this is enough reason for me to vote them in, ahead of the passive/safe PAP yes-man/backbenchers in parliament who may not contribute to any meaningful inputs.

Point being many of the oppos have/could have had illustrious careers as lawyers, doctors. even the government scholars, or ex PAP members who have went to the other side. These ppl are doing it because they truly care, not because they got parachuted in or need the salary.

Even ppl like Lim Tean who is borderline unhinged, he was a successful lawyer but decided his calling for sg politics. or going further back like JBJ who basically fell from brilliant lawyer to bankruptcy after being sued, and they STILL fight. CSJ too for however unprofessional he was in the past, it takes passion/belief to continue fighting till today. And I don’t think you need to be particularly empathetic to be able to feel someone else’s genuine strong conviction/passion.

I know for a fact that new PAP mp in that grc/smc isn’t going to make any significant pushback/checks. On the flip slide, I believe the respectable oppo are passionate about real change, and therefore I am more inclined to vote these people in.

">what makes you so sure WP wouldn’t do even worse? 

I wouldn't know. That's why track records help right?it's not a 2-week thing. We observe what they did over the past 5 years and decide. For new candidates, only time will tell. 

Which is why mentorship, candidate's demeanor, the party's manifesto and what they stand for as a party are important. 

It's like how you observe a person and decide whether you like this person or want to keep your distance from that person right? You may not always be right in your judgement, but actions generally are louder than words for you to make the judgement. And the observation doesn't stop at the end or because of the GE. It continues until that person decided not to be a politician. 

>After all opposition would do and say anything to win.

And yet, the lack of action from the PAP (the irony in the name TBH) is what saddens me. I admit that some ministers in PAP are legit good. They are competent and responsive. Since they're not in my constituency, I have to vote according to who I think I want to give it a try or keep the status quo right? TBH it's not even PAP against any party. It's more like it will apply to any party as long as dissatisfaction lingers in that 5 years.

Dr. Paul eventually lost by 4% (2,509 votes).

"""Can a new party do it? Question mark""

The PAP will form the next government, not the WP or any other oppo party. None of the oppos are contesting enough wards to win and form the next government.

At this point in our lives, the oppo exists solely to challenge the policies put forth by the PAP, where relevant, as well as put forth suggestions of their own. The oppo is still quite powerless.

No harm voting an oppo party in if you feel the ones campaigning in your constituency are credible enough. Even if the WP wins 1 or 2 more constituencies, all our ministers will still be PAP members. 

Personally, I hope the oppo parties if elected, voice out more for:
- controlling the sky-rocketing prices of resale HDBs

- changing the BTO scheme to one where you wait for a year or less, rather than booking your flat 5 years in advance cause that's just fucking ridiculous and like it causes some S&D imbalances (I've brought this up to my ex MP Tan Chuan Jin but I found him to be an arrogant chap)

- ensuring a level playing field for fresh graduates in finding jobs here. I used to work at one of the Big 4 auditing firms here.

"my 2 cents take on the matter:

Im on the fence with both. PAP is good but can be better. Opposition meanwhile, (ok for simplicity's sake, lets mainly consider SDP PSP and WP), is also good, however so far as far as i can see doesn't have many super convincing individuals that will instantly make me ""ok let's vote for oppo in"". A few reasons regarding this stance:

* Many people, including opposition parties, have been harping on the 2% gst increase. Rough calculations based off the budget 2025 at least, suggests that the 2% gst is indeed actually effectively offset using the vouchers. In fact, more than that is actually covered, depending on your spending power (the lower, the higher the subsidy/ set off) etc. Ok hear me out ah, based off google summary at least: In 2023, the average Singaporean household spent $5,931 monthly. This translates to 71,172 annual, and a 2% increase roughly translates out to 1423 per yr ish. However, lets check the budget 2025.  
   1. Sg60 vouchers 600
   2. Assurance package 100-600
   3. GST voucher scheme 450 - 850
   4. Culture pass 100
   5. Activesg 100
   6. Personal income tax rebate 0-200
   7. CDC vouchers 800
   8. U-save 440 - 760
   9. s&cc rebate 1.5-3.5 months offset
   10. climate vouchers 400
* So, u are getting anywhere from 2990 minimum up to 4k+, and this covers way more than the median household increment they would face from 2% GST. If we only look at pure cash they give straight up (so exclude rebate, climate vouchers etc), 800 + 600 + 100 (CDC voucher + sg60 voucher + minimum from AP), and its alr more than 1400. Shit on PAP all you want, but lets give credit where its due: They really did offset the 2% increase for at least 50% of the populace, and for the rest, come on la, you are already earning more than the rest, and you spend way more on non-necessities, not really PAP's fault liao right? PAP did highlight this increase has been delayed for quite some time (Even back in 2012, there was talks of increasing GST to 10%, although this was met with immense backlash), and now they cannot put it off any longer in view of an ageing population and needing more funds to tackle this. Unpopular opinion, but i cannot find fault with this logic at all. 

* What i can however find fault with, is the fact that inflation is rather high. The number in % doesn't seem a lot, but the trickle-down effects is very much present in our everyday expenses. Pre COVID i rmb my avg cai fan being like 4-4.50 max, now its like 5-5.50 (wtf?) in my area. Yeah, its not that i dont understand its due to factors p much outside PAP's control, however, they can definitely do better in this regard, in mitigating the effects at least.",2,4/27/25 9:41,ytolololol,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Thanks for the very mature attempt to understand other people's perspective without mudslinging etc. This is what our country needs to mature politically.

For me, I vote mainly on character, for better or for worse. I am not so noble as to vote based on what is best for my neighbourhood or for the country. I am just a normal self-interested average Jane asking just one question: which group of people would I rather talk to at the MPS when s*** happens in my life (never say never, and it has happened to me before twice) and I desperately need help? 

To put it in the most polite way possible, I evaluate based on three criteria:
1) is the team approachable, not just logistically (orderly queues and system) but emotionally? I.e. will I feel like I have to say grandmother's story just to get the other side to understand 10% of my issues? Or it's more rapport and 心有灵犀一点通 (I think what youngsters call ""vibing"")
2) throughout the whole process do I get the ""we are honoured to serve you"" vibe or do I get the ""you are a charity case/your issue is hardly an issue in our perspective and you should be appreciative that you are even allowed to join the queue"" vibe
3) do I genuinely believe that they will actually tackle my concerns, not just by writing the requested letters, but by raising the issues in Parliament so the root cause of my problem is resolved?

Let's just say that 1) I do not live in Hougang. 2) I am a very unhappy customer. 3) to answer the ""what does the opposition offer"" part of your question, for the opposition that is contesting in my area, I see a great deal of potential of them meeting my three criteria listed above. Of course there is no ""try before you buy"", but that's life.

"Why I would vote opposition this GE.

1) To prevent PAP from becoming an echo chamber and promote diversity of opinion. Specifically, I am uncomfortable with so many civil servants being parachuted into various high level roles without (in my opinion) relevant credentials and experience. 

Case in point, NTUC income saga - this was such a typical M&A / PE strategy, that anybody who had some experience in investment banking could smell this miles away. It really makes me question the leaders competence since they said it was in ""good faith"" as well as whether the overall plan of air-dropping ex-generals into various high ranking places makes sense. 

2) I personally feel that some PAP candidates are less hungry to improve the system, instead are just satisfied with maintaining the status quo. This in the long-run will result in organizational inefficiency and stagnation, which I actually do see within certain civil service branches. Any system that does not evolve will be left behind, as we have seen with many of the old-gen ""famous"" local companies (e.g. Hin Leong's lack of proper risk management)

On the other hand, WP candidates overall seem competent and eager to prove their worth and willing to question existing status quo for improvement. I believe that this is good for any well functioning organization. Sadly, I find it hard to say the same for most other opposition parties. 

On specifically housing affordability, 

WP's manifesto kind of addresses it in a mild-way with the overarching message that houses are meant for Singaporeans to stay in, instead of being seen as a safe haven investment. I agree with the message but not the implementation steps, which I feel could be more forceful (probably to err on side of caution with voters). 

Tried and tested ways of making investment properties less attractive could include taxing rental income / capital gains on non-owner occupied properties, increasing property tax for non-owner occupied properties significantly or even like a hefty estate tax on non-owner occupied properties.",2,4/28/25 5:58,Select-Move-5107,1,0,0,0,0,0

"Take a look at the WP team in Aljunied and Sengkang. Look at how theyve grown, and you can see real true passion and genuineness from them in wanting to better the political scene and help their residents. Its bloody tough being the opposition, and the PAP purposely makes it ridiculously tough, yet they still chose to be opposition and work extra hard for their passions.

on the other hand, look at some of these people living in their civil service bubble, being parachuted in from god knows where. The system makes it super easy for them to get in (just get into a GRC with SMLee or LW or shan) and they can literally cruise their way into parliament without any accountability. Just do what the party wants you to do, collect a nice pay, dont rock the boat, and even working hard for the residents is optional. These people will barely work for you and couldnt give two shits about your wellbeing, for them its all about prestige and money rather than pure passion.

I like WP because I have a neat ability to see right through peoples intentions and I can sniff a snake from miles away. WP people have always been genuine and have walked the talk.

"some of the reasons for me would be:

- def deny ruling party a supermajority. I did not like the GST changes for instance, and no amount of vouchers can convince me otherwise

- as a young voter, I think I am unfairly pitted against the elite and the rich factions of society. I see an uphill struggle, be it rising to a level of comfortability, or securing proper housing. I don't think the current ruling party is doing much to address this. I think we need more ""socialist"" policies, for the lack of a better word

- even if I vote for a ""siaolang"" oppo, my personal experience in living in both oppo and incumbent wards is that I've not felt the effects of which town council I'm staying in. so idt voting oppo, even the brain dead ones, is gonna cause my living experience to immediately go topsy turby in the unlikely event they are elected. worst case scenario, I just vote back PAP in the next election. but on the best case, I may attain a favorable outcome, in terms of policy, in terms of actions on the ground

- my GRC is one that had an ""anchor MP"" that got moved in like 2 to 3 days before election, and I definitely, don't appreciate that. if you wanna stand in my area, I want to have you seen your face for at least a year.

- oh one last thing I wanted to add, civil service salaries are absolute dog shit. I absolutely hate the fact that people who are working to serve for us, be it teachers, nurses, etc. are paid worse than ever? the fact that a teacher, unless he becomes senior management or something, cannot break 10k regardless of how hard he works, is just mind-boggling to me. and what do we have to blame? a materialistic, profit first government. other than salaries, career progression is also fked.",3,4/26/25 16:09,lurkingeternally,1,0,0,0,0,0
"People here don't understand a few things.

1. The amount of foreign confidence other countries have because of the huge incumbent vote percentage. The moment that is significantly lowered, so will our branding of stability.

 2. Having more ""voices"" just for the sake of it will clip our wings for nimbleness amidst crisis. Look at how often the western government freezes just because there is a lock of opinions. People think that opposition will automatically vote sensibly while seriously disregarding the fact that opposition would as likely vote according to party lines as the incumbent. 

 3. Compared to global standards, even the current day govt with covid and trade, we are at the top 10%. To expect anybody without strong leadership experience to lead it will more likely vote in a worse leadership team than the current one. Basic risk vs reward. The reward to improve from 10% to 5% is much more unlikely as compared to dropping to below 20%. The moment that happens, parties will just vote for extremes such as the left and right in the west and we will always lose the stability forever.

 4. The more people hate incumbent and support oppo publicly, fewer talents will join the incumbent from all sectors - public, people and private. Afterall, why would people risk their lives, lose their privacy, get hatred and work 24/7 with zero job security, when they can get equal or more compensation at their current jobs? 

Its truly insane how much the support for opposition automatically comes for so many people. I understand when they are 18-20 but when people are 30 and still think like that, I worry for the future of sg.

it’s like how singtel was the only player until starhub and m1 came along. and now eight, circles, zero1, simba. they brought competition and that make everyone better. 

pap now is like mediacorp. there’s no competition. they think they are so good and great. they don’t listen to any one and have new ideas on how to be better. and because they are the only player, they can do whatever they want. that include doing shit content that no one care. that also include doing dirty means just to get halimah yacob become the president. 

personally i feel the whole system is flawed already. instead of debating and solving problems, in parliament its feels like classroom bickering and all being damn childish. and every ministers are just busy being a rockstar. taking over credit from every one who worked so hard, who worked on their script and yet they just become the guest of honour for all the events. we also often feel like we are being talked down. 

pap was an opposition party too. pap didn’t know how to be a government too. pap didn’t know how to run a town council too. everyone start somewhere. workers party founder david marshall was the first elected chief minister when lky was just merely in the opposition. david marshall then went on to start workers party after running for two years or so. the workers party weren’t nobody. and lky isn’t god. there’s goh keng swee, and the rest who was so good in what they do. but it seems lky was taking all the glory. 

whatever it is. every one sucks also. their speeches aren’t like lky. everyone is just reading the script not writing by themselves. things were not like before anymore. back then none for them stay in gcb. 

if they can just raise gst to 9% now without any contest or debate. they can also just raise to 20% in the future. with so much power, it’s very dangerous. 

singapore took the easy way out of raising gst. we are the only few countries amongst the world that does that during this hard times. israel and india is one of them. but india things are dirty cheap so that the increase doesn’t matter.

i want to worry not for myself but for our youth . it’s so hard to find a job, so stressful for this psle and flawed result driven education system. where tuition seems a must now. even if they work so hard, they will never get important big roles cause they are usually your ang mohs or reserved for president scholars from the army or not or something. and not to talk about bto or resale. it’s close to a million for resale now. and new citizens get favoured for the bto because their vote would be secured. while you are stuck with the resale that you probably cannot afford or take years to be in debt. 

if you ever work in the civil sector u will actually know the whole system is flawed also. damn slow. damn out of touch with the real world. and stupid solutions and suggestions. 

we just need to hire an estate manager to run the town council. like how condos are doing. why do we need politician to do that? a lot of mp aren’t speaking up. those who do. are party whipped or probably asked to leave. 

i am not against any politician who are running. but if its party before yourself then means pap mp have no voice and are just following pap order being a yes man. then what’s the point? hence the whole pap system is flawed. 

it’s not fun to be in singapore anymore. our hotels are shit high. tourists are complaining it’s expensive and boring. there’s nothing to do here other than to eat. many won’t come more than once. there’s no culture anymore. no music no movie no sports. it’s just work to pay your debt culture if any. there’s no more bookstores or many local brands. landlord are killing everyone with high rental. it’s not cool being here anymore. bangkok taipei seoul are doing so much more in the fun department. our orchard road is so dead. vietnam is so happening also. 

as such a rich nation, our citizen should generally be happy. but most aren’t.
